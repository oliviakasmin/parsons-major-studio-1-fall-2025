The Committee on Revolutionary Claims to whom were referred the petition and papers of Maryett Van Buskirk, heir of Thomas Van Buckirk, respectfully report: That they have examined this case with great care, and they unanimously concur that the facts set forth by the petitioner are fully sustained by the evidence. It appears that the petitioner, Maryett Van Buskirk, is the lineal descendant of Thomas Van Buskirk, who was in his lifetime a citizen of Bergen County, New Jersey. That during the period of our revolutionary struggle he was a wealthy farmer and grazier, and a man of great influence. The evidence before your committee shows, that he was one of the most ardent whigs of the revolution, and in a community where a large part of the population was hostile to the American cause. It further appears from the evidence and certificates on file, that the American troops at different times, under the command of Generals Wayne, Greene, and other officers, during the period ranging between the years 1777 and 1780, encamped at Harrington, (or Peramus, as sometimes called,) in said county and State. in the latter years, the winter of 1779-80, General Washington with the main army were encamped at Morristown, near by. When your committee state that, as early as the year 1777, dates the poverty and extreme wants of the army, and the prostration of the credit of the government, they state facts known to all men. It abundantly appears by the evidence, that from this time, while our army was in winter quarters at Valley Forge, until the year 1780, the said Thomas Van Buskirk was frequently applied to by the several officers commanding the American troops for supplies of cattle, horses, forage, grain, and other necessary articles, all of which he furnished; and he frequently purchased articles from others with his own money, to enable him to supply the army.

Also, a privited history of said Church, in pamphlet form, on page 83 of which there is a note stating that the records from 1777 to 1799 are lost, also page 80 Rev. B. Van Derline. This evidence accounts for the failure to produce record proof of the marriage of said Claimant, in 1784. 8th By reference to the Bounty & and files in the Pension Office, it will be seen that said Peter Van Buskirk, the claimant in April 1855, made a declaration for Bounty land, in Phelps, N.Y. where then resided, stating his age to be ninety-four years.

State of New Jersey, Morris County ss: On this 30th day of August in the year of our Lord 1838, personally appeared before the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas of said County, Martha Emmel, a widow of Morris town in the County of Morris, aged years, who being first duly sworn according to law, doth on her oath, make the following Declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the provisions made by the act of Congress, passed July 7th 1838, entitled an act, granting half pay & pensions to certain widows. I am the widow of George Emmel, who was a soldier in a Battalion or Regiment raised in Philadelphia, called Colonel Cadwalader Battalion or Regiment, as I understood from my husband. How long he served, I am unable to say, nor can I tell in what other Regiment if any, he did other duties. I think he was then attached to the Pennsylvania line, but am not positive. I believe he was engaged considerable time, in being of the Army in & near to Albany, & along the Hudson river, & at Pompton [not clear] in the State of New Jersey, & my impression is that this was toward the close of the war & that he then was employed in the Commissary or Quarter Masters Department. For details & specifications of his services, I refer the Commission of Pensions to his original Declaration now on file in the Pension Office, and under the law of the U. States of March, 1818, under which he was admitted on the Pension roll of the N. Jersey Agency & was suspended under the law of 1820, & was finally restored to the roll, & recd his pension till his death. -- My name before my marriage was Martha Winons, & I was generally called Patty. My father was Isaac Winons, & he lived when I was a girl at Bottle Hill, now called Madison, in this County. I was married to the said George Emmel at my father's [crossed out] a Mr. Butlers home by Revd Mr. Bradford, then Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Bottlehill on the 7th day of April, in the year in which the rejoicing & illumination of Morris town & the neighboring villages, for peace, took place, by bonfires and burning of tar barrels etc: & I believe it was the year 1782. I believe there is no Parrish record of marriages kept in that church of that early period, as apprantly a certificate of Revd. Mr. Aimes, the present Pastor. I have a family bible, containing a record of our marriage & births of our children a leaf of which bible containing said records I send to the Pension officer, with this Declaration, which I truly believe is a true record.

These twenty or twenty-one negroes Major Wigg went after, and recovered without molestation, and retained possession of them up to the period of his death, and died under the impression that he was not liable for their value; but in this he was mistaken, for his son after his death was forced to pay for them in full, and he did so. Major Wigg never made application to Congress for relief, in consequence of his belief, up to the period of his death, in the poverty of the government, but it is evident that he designed doing so, from the fact that he made an affidavit to the extent of his losses, (which original paper is among the evidence in the case ) and left it in the possession of his brother-in-law Thomas Hutson, Esq., who was also the magistrate before whom it was executed, undoubtedly with the view of its being placed in the possession of his son, at that time a youth in Princeton college, but it so happened that Mr. Hutson also died soon after Major Wigg, and before the return of Major Wigg's son from college. In this way the paper was lost sight of, and never recovered until recently it was found, by W. M.

That Major Wigg was a legal hostage by the act of the British authorities and by the acquiescence of General Greene, and that his property was taken from him by the British while he was a hostage, and for causes growing out of that condition of hostageship, is clearly proven to the satisfaction of the committee. The committee are also perfectly satisfied that neither Major Wigg nor any of his representatives have ever received any compensation for his losses, either from the government of South Carolina or from the United States.

""Your committee approach this subject, fully apprised of the danger of cherishing a spirit of innovation, or dissenting from the long es tablished customs of society ; but, they are equally convinced, that when customs, however venerable for their antiquity, or sanctioned by universal prevalence, are obviously useless in themselves, and injurious in their tendency, they constitute an oppressive domination that may and should be resisted,--and, such, in the opinion of your committee, is the custom of wearing fashionable mourning garments as indicative of grief. [Right page] 5 ""It is certainly is not commended to our observance by any considera tions of practical utility,--there is nothing in the HUE more than in a peculiar [begin italics]form[end italics] of dress that is expressive of the desolation of heart consequent upon afflictive bereavements. This view of the subject is fully sustained by the fact, that a diversity of colors have been adopted by different nations for this purpose. Some have preferred to mourn in white, others in black, and it would require an ingenious casuist to assign very plausible reasons for the preference of either.-- If a mere display of sorrow be the object in view, it is difficult to con ceive, why [begin italics[grief,[end italics] rather than any [begin italics]other passion[end italics] should assume a pe culiar garb, or obtrude itself upon the public eye in any form of ex hibition ; unless indeed, pride must be gratified even in the trappings of death, and parade and display attend the mortifying monuments of the curse of sin. It is moreover to be feared, that there are cases, where the habiliments of mourning, are but the disguise of the most base and contemptible hypocrisy. It is very possible, and perhaps not of unfrequent occurrence, that it covers any thing but sadness; it is alike assumed by the vicious and the virtuous, the benevolent and the [illegible]; it may sometimes indicate a wounded spirit, or, the heir in his weeds of woe may be exulting in heart, that he is following to the grave the only obstacle to the gratification of his cupidity. ""But inutlity is not the only objection that may be urged against this custom; considerations of a more serious character, call for une quivocal expressions of disapprobation of a practice evidently unhap py, if not injurious in it tendency. It is worthy of serious consider ation, whether the Apostolic precept, 'Be not conformed to the world,' is not infringed, by the conformity of professing christians, to a cus tom unsustained by the precepts of the Saviour, or the example of the Apostles, and having nothing to recommend it, but the fashion of the world. Should this point, however, be conceded, and it be ad mitted that there is nothing to direct us upon this subject in the New Testament; yet the embarrassment to which it subjects an afflicted family, is a sufficient reason to induce a renunciation of the practice. If there is ever a time when seclusion and serious reflection are de sirable, it is when God visits our families in a dispensation so solemn and affecting; there is much that is revolting to a sensitive and deli cate mine, in these circumstances, to be compelled to give then atten tion to the fitting of dresses, and the quality of goods, and the officious suggestions of friends with relation to their personal appearance. In fine, when the body is oppressed with fatigue, wearied with unremit ted and affectionate attention around the bed of sickness and death, and the spirit is overwhelmed with sorrow, when the one requires rest, and the other communion with God, these impertinent interrup tions are not only embarrassing, but frequently distressing in the ex treme. There is another evil inseparably connected with this custom, which should be seriously considered; its imperious demands upon the often limited resources of the survivors.

And the deponent further on oath declares that he served not less than the periods herein before specified at the times and under the command of the officers as mentioned by him, making an aggregate of Twenty one months and three days service performed by him as a private soldier, independent of his service as a substitute for Richardson, his hiring with his squad in his company, a substitute for one month to join the American Army previous to the Battle of Monmouth and the various services entered by him as a volunteer Minuteman in suppressing the inroads of the British and Tories interacting the communication between them and the disaffected in the country and cutting off their supplies and which is more particularly set forth in his former declaration, to which this is an amendment and for which services he cannot affix any precise length of time, as they were rendered by him at different times on different days, more or less during the Revolutionary War. To the Interrogatories prescribed by the War Department, he answers: I - He was born in Elizabeth Town township in the County of Essex and State of New Jersey on the 10th day of February A.D. 1760. II - That the record of his age was entered in his father's family Bible; a transcript from which upwards of twenty year past was entered in his family Bible where it is now to be seen. III - That he lived in Elizabeth Town township County of Essex and State of New Jersey when called into service and continued residing there until the year 1821 when he removed to Monroe County and since that to Niagara County, both in the State of New York, where he now resides. IV - He was a volunteer, a drafted person, and a substitute for one William Richardson at the times and for the periods set forth in this declaration. V - He served at different periods when Col. Elias Dayton and Col. Matthias Ogden with their Continental Troops of the New Jersey line were acting in concert, as likewise Capts. Neal, Pratt, Pearson, Lieuts. Edmund Thomas, William Shute, Ephraim, Whitlock, Huet again (the last of which he saw both before and after he was killed at Connecticut Farms) and others mentioned in his former declaration. He recollects Col. Elias Dayton's Regiment of New Jersey Continentals being often on duty with them. Col. William Washington's Cavalry and Capt. Huet's company of Continental Artillery, Col. Seeley's militia regiment from Morris County and Col. Jaques's and Col. Samuel Potter's Militia Regiments of Essex County, State of New Jersey. Under the officers belonging to these two last regiments, he principally performed his different tours of duty as set forth in this and his former declaration. VI - That he never received any discharge from any officer under whom he served from the service, none being demanded by him or deemed exquisite by them as this deponent and his officers resided in the same County and were well acquainted with each other. VII - That now as in his former declaration he says that he is well acquainted with Major Benjamin Barton, Isaac Colt Jr., Zina A. Colvin, Esq., and Leonard Shepard, who annexed to his former declaration have testified to his character for veracity and Leonard Shepard to his belief in his revolutionary services [crossed out: and]. Although there is no settled Clergyman in Lewiston, since the making of his former declaration has ascertained from the Reverend Cornelius Mars, an aged Clergyman residing in the township of Lewiston and Niagara County, and who was acquainted with him many years in the State of New Jersey. That he will testify to his character for veracity and belief of his services as a Revolutionary Soldier, to which he, the deponent, adds John Cook's affidavit with the proper attestation of his character for veracity. That he yet knows of no surviving witness except John Cook, by whom he can prove his actual service during or in the war. That he is poor and infirm and not able to undergo any great expenses in searching for such testimony but that he has reason to believe most part of those with whom and under whom he served are dead or residing in places out of his knowledge.

We think those things should be dwelt upon in the ministration of the word it will have a good effect on the child of grace--it will lead him to realize with pleasure, the truth of that doctrine and instruction, the Apostle gave to Titus, 111 chap. 3, 7 : [begin italics]For we ourselves, were sometimes foolish, disobedient, serving divers lusts and pleasure, liv ing in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another; but, after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done ; but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renew ing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life:""[end italics] The Apostles further observes, that this is a faithful saying; meaning the whole of what is before expressed in the above verses, concerning the state and condition of the people of God by nature--the appearance of the love and kindness of God to them--the salvation of them according to the the mercy of God, and not by works of righteousness ; regenera tion by the spirit of God in which so much grace is communicated, and justification by the free and sovereign grace of God, as God's method of salvation, by which the children of God are made to ap pear to be heirs of eternal life, and to have a good hope of it through this grace. Now all of this is a faithful saying, and true doctrine to be believed ; [begin italics]""And these things I will that thou affirm constantly;""[end italics] That is the above doctrine. Now it appears that the Apostle would have Titus be assured of these truths himself, and without any doubt concerning them, and abide firm in them, and speak of them with cer tainty, boldness, and confidence to others, and endeavor to establish his brethren in them ; and for this purpose, would have them fre quently inculcated and insisted on ; and, that with this further view, that they that have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works ; nothing can more strongly engage as a motive for the per formance of good works, than the frequent insisting on the above doctrines of grace, for they are good and profitable unto men. These things are very profitable and useful to influence faith, hope, love, and a cheerful obedience to the will of God. Nothing has a greater ten dency to promote humility and check pride in the saints, than to re flect on their past life, the state and condition they were in, when the love and kindness of God their Saviour appeared to them. In refer ence to this, the Apostle cries out, [begin italics]""This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief,""[end italics] and again, [begin italics]""Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints,""[end italics] &c. When the child of God thinks of the condition he was in, when the Lord quickened his dead soul, and called him with a holy calling, and gave him a good hope through grace, he is astonished at the long suffering and goodness of God, who hath spared him amid all his [Right page] 9 sins and rebellion, who hath given his dear Son to redeem and save him from the lowest hell. Thus the Goodness of God leadeth him to repentance, to that repentance that needed not to be repented of. He feels his obligation, and his language is, Lord what wilt though have me to do, what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits? Thus we see brethren, (as might easily be gathered from a num ber of other portions of Scripture, would the limits of a Circu lar admit,) the good tendency of evangelical matter in preaching. God is glorified in showing that his people are saved by his grace; his children are instructed, edified, and comforted; and it also promotes a holy life and godly conversation. As it regards the manner, we have the Apostles also for our exam ple and pattern; they did not use [begin italics]""enticing words of man's wisdom,"" ""but seeing we have this hope, we use great plainness of speech.""[end italics] They did not use guile or deceitfulness, but renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but seeing they were put in trust with the gospel, they so spake not as pleasing men, but God ; who tried their hears, and as stewards of the mysteries of God, they were faith ful ; they kept back no part, but declared [begin italics]""all the counsel of God.""[end italics] This they did sincerely, fervently, and with boldness, not intimidated by the threats of men; none of these things moved them, they counted not their lives dear unto them, so that they might finish their course with joy, and the ministry they had received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. Brethren, we have great cause to lament, that by many professed preachers of the gospel, the example and pattern is lost sight of ; a large majority of hearers, and alas, too many professors would have their ministers to prophecy smooth things, that their preaching may not have the evil tendency of offending and scattering the congre gation, or the still more pernicious tendency of cutting off the ears. Thus fearing men rather than God, it has fully come to pass in many instances, like people--like priest; and it is to be feared, that the real object in view is to be well thought of ; and for this purpose, the glorious truths of the gospel are kept back or completely wrapped up, to the great injury and disadvantage of the children of Zion, and the delusion of sinners, who are pleased to have it so. Brethren, let us remember the words of our blessed Master, whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy Angels ; let us not be ashamed of the gospel of Christ, but stand fast in faith, and contend earnestly for the same, holding fast a form of sound words, endeavoring to strengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die. The doctrine of the blessed gospel, is now given up by many who once professed to believe it, and others are halting between two opin ions. Let brethren in the ministry be faithful, and speak the truth as it is in Jesus, fully, clearly, and plainly; let them strictly adhere to the Apostolic matter and manner of preaching, and ardently protest against every thing that is not perfectly in accordance therewith, however 2",widow,god||lord||suffering,hopelessness||religion

After General Howe left New Brunswick, the Tories and disaffected assembled on Staten Island and became, in conjunction with the British Regular force stationed there, very troublesome by the continued inroads and marauding parties they sent out. The deponent was actively employed with other militia, often under different Militia Officers either of his own regiment or of those of the neighboring Counties, in cutting off the communication between the disaffected in the County and the enemy, restraining their plundering parties and capturing provisions intended for their use, one yoke of fat cattle in particular intended for the enemy, he captured himself from one of the disaffected (although his opponent was armed with pistols) and which were confiscated by the legal authority; his activity and vigilance rendered him so obnoxious to the secret adherents of the enemy that he was privately fired at and various opportunities sought by the disaffected and Tories to capture him. These duties, whether as Guard Patrol or in case of alarm, either detached, on detail or acting as volunteer, this deponent directly avers that he performed more or less from the spring of 1776 until the spring of 1782 as his place of nativity and residence was continuous to the lines of the enemy. In the spring of 1778, his company, among whom was himself, commanded by Capt. Thomas Mulford of the Essex County Militia, hired substitutes by a general contribution from among the company and who joined General Washington's Army previous to the Battle of Monmouth. He, among others, remaining on the lines near Staten Island, continued performing different tours of duty more or less during the year and ensuing winter. The Tories and enemy capturing a considerable number of the inhabitants of Essex and the adjoining counties conveyed them to the Sugar House Provost Prison &c. in the City of New York. To check these depredators required considerable vigilance and activity in the militia in which this deponent largely partook. General Washington was encamped during the winter at Middlebrook to the best of his remembrance. In the spring of 1779, this deponent in a company commanded by Capt. Eliakim Little or Thomas Clark of the militia - he cannot at present say which - marched with others in pursuit of the enemy through Newark, Bellville, and Aquacanac [Aquackananonk], where crossing the Passaic River into Bergen County they had a pretty smart skirmish with the enemy at a place called The Cedars, who were compelled to retire to Hackensack. Shortly after his return, he became a substitute for one William Richardson on a secret militia expedition; officers names not recollected except David Thurston, who was adjutant. They marched from Morristown to Whippany, thence to Paramus toward Bergen County but was taken sick and returned home on furlough. Sometime in the summer of this year, a large body of British Regulars and Green Coats (who were Tories) crossed from Staten Island to the Elizabeth Town salt marshes in the night, pressed on to the town where they were met and opposed by a strong militia force under General Wynes. The deponent was in his regiment commanded by Col. Jaques and had a pretty severe skirmish with them when they marched by Newark, crossing the Passaic River into Bergen County, followed and harassed by the militia all the route with considerable loss to the enemy from Bergen. He thinks they recrossed to Staten Island. The Whig Militia of the Counties in New Jersey contiguous to the City of New York and that seaboard at the commencement of the war had formed themselves into a body styling themselves, ""Minute Men"" who when not on detailed duty as Guard &c. were ever ready to turn out and meet the enemy, night or day. To this body of men this deponent belonged until the cessation of hostilities and marauding parties of the enemy found frequent employment for them in repelling their inroads. In the winter, General Lord Sterling, with a body of regulars and militia provided with artillery, crossed on the ice from Elizabeth Town to Staten Island (this being what is termed the hard winter) for the purpose of attacking the British ports. This deponent, in his company commanded...",soldier,cattle||lord,religion||animals

Thomas Mulford of the militia, accompanied this expedition. After some slight skirmishing, the enemy abandoned their outposts and retreated to their fortifications at The Narrows, which were deemed too strong to be forced. After burning their barracks at Ryerson's Ferry, the American troops retired, bringing off their captured stores. The troops under General Washington laying at Morristown this winter and in a suffering condition. The deponent voluntarily turned out with his own team and transported forage and provisions raised among the inhabitants by contribution to their relief without receiving, or expecting to receive, any remuneration for the same. Late in the fall previous to this, he crossed with other volunteers under Capt. Nathaniel Fitz Randolph of Middlesex, to the surprise of the British Guard on Staten Island and succeeded in capturing four, the remainder eight made their escape; it being night and they engaged at the moment of surprise in relieving guard. In June 1780, General Kniphausen landed at Elizabeth Town in the night with a large British force and marched with silence towards Morristown, the American Head Quarters. They were discovered by the deponent and others while yet in the town and he lost no time in communicating intelligence of their movements to Col. Elias Dayton of one (of) the New Jersey Regular regiments who was stationed at no great distance and himself joined the assembling militia under the command of Major William Crane, in firing upon and harassing the enemy on their march, who were likewise vigorously opposed by Col. Dayton's Regulars. At Connecticut Farms they were held in cheek by the Continental Troops aided by the militia with a piece of artillery in charge of Captain Eliakim Little, after setting fire to the meetinghouse and more than half of the buildings in the place and with other outrages, shooting Mrs. Caldwell, wife of the Rev'd James Caldwell, the Presbyterian Clergyman and a noted Whig, while her child was in her arms and in her own house. They retreated that night to Elizabeth Town after having sustained a very considerable loss, harassed continually by the militia on their retreat. In this battle he saw Lieut. Moses Ogden of the New Jersey Regulars lying dead in the road, shot thru [through] the head. The enemy fortified in Elizabeth Town where they remained a week, during which time the neighboring militia, among whom was this deponent, were continually employed in harassing their outposts and watching their movements. At the expiration of that time having been reinforced, they once more marched in the night toward Morristown in two divisions, one moving on main direct, the other on the Vauxhall Road, a harassing fire was kept up on them by the militia until their arrival at Springfield where they were met and opposed before and after their entrance into the village by a large regular force, detached by General Washington from Morristown for that purpose. They were commanded by General Green, to the best of this deponent's recollection. This force with the militia checked their further progress and after burning the meetinghouse and nearly every building in the place, they commenced a rapid retreat to Elizabeth Town and thence during the night to Staten Island, harassed by the regulars and militia, their loss was very considerable. This deponent was actively engaged with the enemy during this action and retreat and saw Captain Nathaniel Fitz Randolph of the militia shortly after he was mortally wounded by the enemy, among other regular officers in these engagements, many of whom at this distant day are forgotten, were Col. Elias Dayton of the New Jersey Line, Capt. Henry and Lieutenant Edmund Thomas. During the remainder of the year of 1780 through the course of the year 1781, and especially after the American Army left New Jersey for Yorktown, and in fact until the spring of 1782, this deponent continued to be detailed for duty by his officers, standing guard patrolling and pursuing the Tories and enemy's parties, who were making continual inroads as usual in one of which they burned the meetinghouse, courthouse and other buildings in Elizabeth Town. At other times carrying off some of the best Whig inhabitants or plundering and destroying others so that this portion of New Jersey near their lines was in a continual state of alarm and suffered very severely from their secret predatory excursions, especially those of the Tories, who were well acquainted with the country, keeping the Essex Militia of which this deponent was one active and vigilant. After the spring of 1782, a kind of a cessation of hostilities took place and continued until peace, very much to the relief of the militia and inhabitants. This deponent avers that the foregoing statement contained only some of the most prominent facts relative to his services for the United States during the Revolutionary War, as he was at various times and places too numerous to particularize under some one or other Militia Officer and much oftener with some of his brother militia men engaged with scouting parties of the Tories...",soldier,suffering||clergyman,hopelessness||religion

And that these duties and fatigues, when not ordered on others by his officers, he was frequent in the performance of, both in the day and night time, from the first landing of the enemy on Staten Island until the cessation of hostilities. He likewise avers that the aggregate time employed by him in performing tours of duty of monthly detail, on guard, garrison duty &c. by command of his regimental officers and in different expeditions, battles, skirmishes &c. with the enemy at various times from the commencement to the close of the Revolutionary War, would considerably exceed two years of active service rendered by him to the United States in the cause of liberty as a soldier. That he was well acquainted with Col. William Washington of the cavalry and Caleb Huet, Joseph Gathen and Daniel Smith, belonging to this corps at one period while quartered in New Jersey, the year he cannot recollect. He was likewise acquainted with Col. Elias Dayton, Col. Matthias Ogden, Col. Barber, Captains Neal, Pratt, Pierson, Jeremiah Ballard, Joseph Bloomfield and Aaron Ogden; both which last have been governors of New Jersey since then, likewise with Lieutenants Edmund Thomas, William Shute, Jonathan Bucastle, Ephraim Whitlock, Shepard Bollock and Capt. Jonathan Dayton, since Speaker of the House of Congress. Many of whom belonged to one or other of the New Jersey Continental Regiments and with most of whom he has been engaged in some one or other engagement with the enemy in New Jersey. They holding as nigh as he can recollect the rank by commission he has affixed to them. Many of their given names at this distance of time he cannot remember. He served under or was well acquainted at that period with General Wyndes, Col. Jaques, Majors Daniel Halsey, Hays, John Craig, William Crane, Captain Benjamin Cory - lieut. afterwards - Capt. Thomas Mulford, Capt. John Scudder, Capt. Thomas Clark, Capt. Jacob Crane, Capt. Anthony Morse, Capt. Brant, Capt. Jonas Wade, Capt. Joshua Horton, Capt. Samuel Meeker of the cavalry, Capt. Eliakim Little of the artillery [crossed out: and] Capt. Matthias Meeker and Lieut Cornelius Williams of the Essex County Militia, Col. Ellis Cook of Morris and Capt. Nathaniel Fitz Randolph of Middlesex, with many others whom he cannot recollect. He was likewise well acquainted at that period with Abraham Clark, one of the Representatives in the Congress and William Livingston, the Patriotic Governor of New Jersey. That at this present time he knows of no surviving witness he can bring to substantiate those services except John Cook, who saw him at the Battle of Springfield in 1780 and whose affidavit of that circumstance is forwarded with this statement. Most of those who served with him or with whom he was acquainted during that arduous struggle for independence being dead, or if living at the present time, are residing in places beyond the knowledge of this deponent. That he has no discharge from the service, it not being deemed requisite nor was one ever demanded. That he continued to reside in Elizabeth Town, County of Essex and State of New Jersey until the year 1821 when he removed to Monroe County and since to Lewiston [Lewistown], Niagara County, State of New York, where he has resided ever since and still continues. That the record of his age from his earliest recollections was entered in his father's Family Bible, a transcript from which a number of years since he carefully entered in his own where it remains among the records of his own family. That he is well acquainted with Major Benjamin Barton, Leonard Sheppard, Isaac Colthan and Lina H.

Matthias Potter of Connecticut Farms, being drafted to such service, making his whole period of active service under the command of his officers as a private soldier during the year 1778, two months independent of the hiring a substitute to join General Washington, before mentioned.

Clark and the neighboring militia to or near Hackensack in Bergen County where they had a skirmish with the enemy. In July an alarm being given that the Green Coats had crossed from Staten Island, this deponent in the Militia Company of Capt. Thomas Mulford was engaged with them, supported by the neighboring militia, the enemy being very considerable, marched by Newark and Bergen, followed and harassed by the militia. That affair occupied five days of actual service rendered by him as a private soldier. In September he engaged as a substitute for one William Richardson for a month's tour of duty and after performing three weeks service he was taken sick at Paramus and returned on furlough, having withdrawn his name in the fall from the roll of the Artillery Company.

In the year 1780 in January, he being with his company commanded by Capt. Thomas Mulford with other militia companies and Continental Troops, the whole under the command of Lord Sterling, crossed on the see [sea] to the attack of the British posts on Staten Island, which he performed three days of service. In February, he volunteered with his horses and wagon to transport voluntary contributions to the American Army, then in a suffering condition. In the month of March he served one month at Elizabeth Town point under the command of Capt. Matthias Potter of Connecticut Farms, being drafted thereto out of his company. In June, General Kniphausen invaded Essex County, New Jersey, during which time he burned Connecticut Farms Village and Springfield.

Dear Sir:- Will you kindly forward to me a statement of the miltiary record of my great-grandfather Jacob Bishop, a revolutionary soldier, with such personal data as your office contains . From Maryland Archives XVIII, at page 191, I find his name given as a member of the ""German Regiment"", discharged July 26, 1779. At page 264 of the same volume, he is listed as a private in the muster roll of Capt. William Heyser's Company of the ""German Regiment"" (Maryland troops), under date of October 23, 1776. At page 265 of the same volume, he is given as a private for the months of July, August, September and October, 1779, in the pay roll of Lt. Col. Welton's Company of the ""German Regiment"" of the Continental Forces of the United States, commanded by Lt. Col. Ludwick Weltner, with the notation that he was discharged July 26, 1779, Jacob Bishop is supposed to have been born in Hagerstown, or at least to have lived there at the time of his enlistment. He died during the year 1816, or prior thereto shortly, leaving a widow whose maiden name was Mary Church. For this search and report I shall be glad to pay your reasonable charges, and will send check in advance, if advised as to the amount. Very truly yours, [signature] H H Rose H. H.

But for want of money and other embarrassing circumstances it was given out, and the Land finally lost. Fifty Six acres remained which is very poor & mostly worn out.

Henry the Immortal Barbourn delivered a funeral elegy in the house of the delegates of Virginia upon the life, patriotism death and burial of Peter Francisco a Revolutionary Soldier. Our beloved Children.- Hebron January 13th. 1831. Through the goodness of God, we your aged parents have lived through another year and began upon a New Year - May we live more devotedly to God this year than we ever have done Jeremiah 28th 16. This year thou shall die. Because thou hast never taught Rebellion against the Lord-- This old Bunker Hill Deputy Commissary never taught Rebellion against the Lord; nor against my beloved country. Your relatives and old neighbors’ [illegible] were as common as [illegible] you the mortality and sickness in Gilead since the cold weather commenced has subsided: there has 19 persons died in this parish last year. I received your [illegible] and affectionate Letter December 16. 1831. It has fully convinced and it has fully satisfied my mind, that it was not best to make any application to our Honorable Congress at present for any compensation for the disposition of final settlement notes, or Continental money that I received for my wages; and the supplies I furnished our Continental army the four first years of our revolutionary war under the command of the Honorable Washington By the Message of the President of the way it appears to me that he is engaged to pay off the national debt, and he is perfectly right. I have been through both Wars. Henry, stand still and read the history of the last war and see the salvation of God in our behalf-- God commanded the sun to stand still for General Jackson and his military to smite the invaders of our Country. Their arms were strengthened by Omnipotent aid! And their guns Fired by an unerring eye or they never could have killed 700 disciplined men and wounded 1400 men and taken 500 prisoners. General Jackson Lost only 7 men killed and 6 men wounded-Sacred and profane history give no such interposition of Divine providence to any army before or since Noah’s flood- This memorable Battle has travelled with yonder Sun upon the wings of the wind among all the Nations of the earth and it will strike a dread to all tyrants and [illegible] [illegible] to our country never to invade our beloved country with impunity; as long as General Jackson is President of the [United] states- there are also many whose minds are so little, that they can conceive nothing great, which does not court the eye in all the trapping of dress, and titles, and eternal splendor. American Patriot!: a Blanket Hero; a General from the plow: all these are terms of ridicule and reproach among many, yet each was Cincinnatus in the best days of Roman virtue- and the Immortal Washington in our day- Henry you will perceive by any newspaper the Speaker also laid before the House a letter from James Monroe late President of the U.S. upon the subject of his claim on the Government of the U.S.. which was referred to the Committee of the whole House-- I don’t believe that President Monroe ever took a final settlement note or old Continental money depreciated- for and by the scale of depreciation made by Congress for his wages if he did he ought to complain or the stones would cry out against him- among the memorials presented to day was one by Mr. Verplank from a number of Officers and Soldiers of the Revolutionary army many of whom served in the battle of Princeton, Saratoga, and Yorktown, but whose cases in consequence of their retirement from the Army, do not come within the provision of the act of 1828, praying to be indemnified for the depreciation of the paper money in which their services were with or for relief in any other made which Congress may think proper to grant; and on motion of Mr. V[erplank] the memorial was referred to a select Committee.

To such men as achieved our independence - Rome in all her glory would have decreed honors and make up the depreciation if they had paid them in old rag money- the Resolves of Congress to transmit the memory of their virtues is worthy of that magnanimity which ought to characterize public bodies-- Jealous and [illegible] rulers are sparing of honors to those who serve them- lest their own should be eclipsed- But your [illegible] Gentlemen can suffer no diminution this way; Henry, I have now sent you an account of the part I took in our revolutionary war and how I received my pay.

I told the captain if I could get a gun I would join their [illegible] as a volunteer-he said it was impossible to get a gun- Sir, you appear to be engaged in our cause-- have taken Sir Charles Burdett an Englishman a prisoner of war he has prevented two companies going on to Lexington by telling them it was a false alarm-Sir, I deliver Sir Charles Burdett into your hands as a prisoner of war to confine him untill called for. I will leave my Sargent to assist you to guard the Prisoner He had a good sword but no gun- I told the Landlord I wanted a room to confine the prisoner; he told me to walk up stairs ;after the Captain had marched on for Lexington about 15 minutes the Sargent went into another Chamber - Sir Charles got up and said that he would go home. I told him that he should not go home he said that he would. I got up to seize hold of him to such of him he struck me around the head with a long hunting whip which made a great whole [sic] round my head- I was a noted wrestler. I sprung upon him like a tiger, flung him down upon the floor and to him by the throat until his face looked as black, as his boot. I asked him what he ment by striking me. The Sargent heard the noise, ran into the room with his sword drawn got off and I will run the blaid [blade] through the body. the British are killing our people and I will kill him. You shall not kill him for he is my prisoner-- The Sargent was a very strong resolute man-- The prisoner begged for his life and I let him get up-- we were called down to dinner the sargent and I dined- I asked the prisoner if he wanted some dinner he said yes. after he had dined I told him to pay for his dinner he said that he had got no money and I paid his dinner. I went out into the back yard and got a hoop pole about six feet long-feeling— the sound of the Cannon and small arms appeared to be nearer- I told the sargent and prisoner to get into the Chaise and if the prisoner tried to make his escape I told the sargent to run him through.

The prisoner asked me he might get out of the carriage and kiss his wife for he never expected to see her again. I told him NO. he kissed his wife and she kissed him and they took their affectionate leave of each other- which brought tears from my eyes: I told the sargent to drive-we stopped at Ames Tavern in Dedham I could hear the Cannon roar 5 or 6 old men ran out of the house that knew Sir Charles two of them with their swords drawn to kill him for they were killing our people at Lexington I told the gentlemen that Sir Charles was my prisoner and they should not kill him. the Sargent and I had hard work to guard our prisoner. we went into the house and told the prisoner to sit in the corner of the room and the Sargent and I would guard him with our weapons. again the old men- they made several attempts to kill him-- no person in the house went to bed that night seventh and that night-- I convinced the old men that it was not right to kill a prisoner- at daylight I delivered up the prisoner to the Sargent and the old [illegible] [illegible] cryed down like a child and said Sir you have saved my life twice [illegible] [illegible] give you any money you ask.

The agent collected all the debts due to me when I was a merchant, and paid it over to me when I was in the army and I paid it out to the men I hired, and for the deficiency of Rations that I did not issue agreeable to the act of Congress-The Supplies that I furnished the Army with: and my wages if I remember right amounted to upwards of Five thousand pounds. the Commissioner never found any fault with one of my charges-- He gave me a final Settlement note for Twelve hundred and four pounds on interest, but no time set for the payment. the Commissioner treated me like a Gentlemen and invited me to dine with him, after dinner he asked me if I wanted to sell the note he gave me - Yes part of it I honestly owe to my Creditors in Boston more than three hundred pounds for goods; they went of with the British when they left Boston. as soon as they return to this Country I want to pay them.

I will rot in jail before I will take that. he said there was no compulsion- I issued provisions at Fishkill [illegible] 6 or 7 months under Commissary General Steward-he paid me my wages in continental money, an old Dutchman offered me one hard dollar for 7 paper dollars, and before I got home I was sorry I had not taken it- when I returned home it was the coldest weather that I ever felt before or since. Tavern keepers were stated and they would not sell at the stated price and I suffered for victuals, and my horse suffered for the want of hay with my pocketfull of [illegible] money. I started one morning at day light and rode three miles and froze both my knees so stiff, that if I bent then thought that they would break off. and from one foot after I got home, I and my Doctor, was afraid that I should lose my [illegible]. I have stated facts upon memory as simple as truth; Pure as light, and level as water. I will not affect a doubt but I have issued more provisions to the army than any commissary in our Revolutionary war for I continued the longest in the service. my Books and vouchers are in the archives of Congress and they will witness for me. I guess that I have been entrusted with a million dollars of Uncle Sam’s property in provisions and money. I never heard one officer or soldier complain of short weight, or measure, and no Regiment ever waited at my store more than three hours for provisions the whole time that I was a deputy commissary. Extract from the Reverend Leo Morse’s history of our Revolutionary war page 320 “The weakness of the [illegible] mention conjunction with flood of certificates or public Securities which Congress could neither fund or pay, occasioned them to depreciate to a very inconsiderable value - the officers and soldiers of the late army and those who furnished Supplies for public emergency were obliged to receive for wages those Certificates or promissory notes when they passed as official, on [illegible] or a tenth of [illegible] nominal value; being thus deprived at once of the greatest part of the reward due for their services; but such as were under the necessity of posting with them, were robbed of that support which they had a right to expect and demand from their countrymen-page 323. The whole history of this Continental paper is a history of public and private fraud- Congress in 1775 Suggested the idea of issuing bills In the purpose of carrying on the war- and this was perhaps their only expedient-money could not be raised by taxation: it could not be borrowed, and on page 327 such is the history of paper money thus far: a miserable substitute for real coin in a country where the reins of government are too weak to compel the fulfillment of public engagements and where all confidence of public [illegible] is totally destroyed - page 319. A remarkable instance of this happened in Connecticut as soon as the tumult of war had but sided an attempt was made to convince the people that the act of Congress passed in 1778 (When I was a Deputy Commissary at Fishkill granting to the officers of the army half pay for life was highly unjust and [illegible]; and that was the first step towards the establishment of pensions and an unreasonable uncontrolled despotism. The Act of Congress passed in 1783. committing half pay for life for five years full pay, was designed to oppose the apprehension of the people and convince them that this gratuity was intended mainly to indemnify the officers for their loss by the depreciation of the paper currency and only to establish a precedent for granting of pentions [sic]-This act however did only satisfy the people who supposed that officers had been generally indemnified for the loss of their pay by the grants made them from time to time by the Legislatures of the several states-besides, the act, while it gave five years full pay to the officers allowing but one year’s pay to the privates. a distinction which had effect in [illegible] escalating and continuing the popular ferment, and one that turned a [illegible] those of the public rage against the officers themselves-I know by four years sad Experience that Camps of all worldly scenes after exhibit the greatest pictures of distress - the sick and the wounded; the dying and the dead; as well as want and sufferings of the living; our Continental Soldiers were almost naked, and bearfooted [sic], in the winter; which brought tears from the Immortal Washingtons eyes; to order them to march against the enemy- Read the address and petition with a pensive mind of our old Continental officers and Soldiers signed by H. Knox-“At this period of the war it is with peculiar pain we find ourselves constrained to address your august body, on matters of a pecuniary nature and objected that the respective States have made settlements, and given bounties for our [illegible]due for part of the time- let the present value of these nominal obligations be [illegible] by the [illegible] men and they will be found little indeed and yet trifling as they are, many have been under the sod near twenty of parting them",widow,distress||pain,hopelessness

This is all the testimony of my husbands service in my knowledge, & it is not probable that I shall be able to find any other. Mr. Condit died within a few weeks after his deposition was taken, & Saml Allen before the widows law had passed. These were the only comrades of my husband, known in this quarter as living, within a few years. The Osborns, two Woolley's, Isaac & Jacob, Stephen Goble, Saml Wood, Jacob & Benjamin Beagle or Beale, Joseph Shipman, Ephraim Fairchild & others belonging to the same co. living within a few miles of us, were well known to my husband & to myself, & not one of them is now living as I verily believe. It is impossible for me to say with any precision, how many years of actual service my husband performed, but I am confident he fulfilled all his engagements to serve. Whether his enlistment under Col. Ogden was for one year only, or for a longer term, I cannot now tell. He was occasionally at home a few days on furlough or parole, & immediately returned to his duty, as a Sergeant in his company, as I always understood; & it is my belief, that his actual service exceeded three years in the war of the revolution. I have heard him speak of skirmishes & battles, in which he was engaged, viz: Mounmouth, Trenton, German town, Brandywine & others not recollected. I am very needy, as well as aged, have no home of my own, but live in a small cabin not my own. I have had 10 children, 6 of them now living, all poor & unable to assist me, & I greatly need whatever pension my Country may allow me for my husband's service in its defence. I was married to my husband, the said Robert Liddle, in August, 1771, when I was 19 years & three months old, by Revd Mr Crossley, Minister of the Baptist Church, called Mount Bethel Church, in Somerset County New Jersey. Beside the family, there were present at our marriage, John Stephens, Mary Sutton & Elsey Ingard, not one of whom is now living. William Cozad was my father, who lived near to the Bethel Church. All the family except myself are dead. I understand there is no parish record of the marriages of that time, nor have I any family record in my possession of our marriage, or of the births of my children. My husband was many years a Constable in Somerset County, & had a book or volume of the Laws of New Jersey, in which he had written down, the time of the birth of our children. I do not know whether it contained the time of our marriage or not. He sold the Law book many years since, & who bought it, or whether it is in being, or where it now is, I know not.

I was also personally acquainted with Rebecca Cozad, before her marriage to said Robert Liddle. we were all young people, living in the same township & County, viz: Somerset, where I now live & have spent my life, & we were in the habit sociable & friendly intercourse. The said Robert Liddle & Rebecca Cozad were married & lived together as husband & wife before the revolutionary by an [?]. They lived near Mount Bethel Church, & had one or two children together, born in wedlock as I believe, before the war began. Said Robert Liddle was an enlisted soldier on the Northern expedition against Canada, & served as a Sergeant as I always understood & believe, in Capt Howell's co. & in Col. Winds' regiment, for the term of one year. He went away from home on that service as was universally said & believed, a little before Christmas, in the year 1775, & returned at the same period in 1776. When he left home on that expedition in 1775, he left his wife & two small children in my neighbourhood. And after his return from Canada, he continued in the Continental army & service as a Sergeant during a considerate part of the war, but how long I am unable to say. Said Robert Liddle moved with his family from Somerset Co. to Morris township in Morris County, about the year 1796. They resided when in Morris Co. not more than 4 miles from me & I knew him & his whole family well, to the time of his death, & up to this time. They raised a large family of sons & daughters, & no one has been heard to question their marriage as I believe. They always lived together reputably, & respected by their neighbours, as husband & wife. Robert Liddle died at his residence in Morris township, in the winter season, between 25 & 30 years ago, & the above named Rebecca Liddle, has not since his death married, but continues his widow to the present time. She is very poor & needy, but is much respected as a woman of fair & unblemished reputation.

I also certify, that there are no records belonging to said congregation, which furnish any account of Marriage by Mr. Crossley, or by his successors, prior to the year 1827, & it is my belief, that no marriage record whatever was kept by said Mr Crossley, during his ministration at Mount Bethel. [The remainder of this page is crossed out] And I hereby further certify, that I was personally well acquainted with Robert Liddle & with Rebecca Liddle his wife, now his widow. They lived together many years as husband & wife, in Smalley town, near Mount Bethel in Somerset Co. & within [blank] miles of my dwelling. They raised a large family of children, & it was never doubted by any one in my knowledge that they were lawfully married. I have known them living together in that character not less than [blank] years, before the death of said Robert Liddle, which took place in Morris township almost 30 years since, where they removed about the year 1796. Robert Liddle was always reputed & believed to be soldier in the war of the revolution by all the older people of the Neighborhood, & I believe no one doubts it. His widow, Rebecca Liddle, has not married since his death, but remains his widow to this day, as I verily believe, & lives in the township & County of Morris, in very indigent circumstances, & justly needing the benefit of the Pension Laws, if from the service of her husband she is entitled thereto. And I hereby further certify that in the original Church word, now in my possession as Clerk, I find the following entry - viz: ""December 24th 1803. the Church meet the day before sacrament ""according to our common practice; after Divine service, came ""forward, Rebecca Littell the wife of Robert Littel & examined, & gave a ""general satisfaction to the Church & was baptized the same day.""",widow,church||pastor||minister,religion

Sir, Perhaps you will now ask; why, I did not make Oath, that I was unable to support myself & obtain the benefits of the pension act of 1818-- Sir, I will tell you why- No Revolutionary soldier, who is sincerely honest, can hold this Government responsible for a single dollar unless he believes, it is for services rendered and not yet paid for; any more than one individual, can hold another, where no value has been received-- the doctrine of a debt of gratitude, is entirely exploded by me full compensation for that demand is derived from the blessings of freedom and independence under our happy form of Government Then, Sir, If it is a debt due from the Government to the soldiers for value long ago received, and standing before God & country, I now fearlessly declare it is, should any soldier who has braved the dangers & periled his life in the most hazardous of all wars, that of revolted Colonies against the mother country, be obliged to swear to his poverty in order to collect a just & legal debt-- I have said a just & legal debt-- I will state Sir, how, I think it became so-- The inability of the Government to pay her soldiers, at the time, that their services were terminated , was the prominent cause of all their subsequent misfortunes - For what could the poor and ragged soldier do, but sell her paper, which was given to him in payment for his service, for what it would bring in the market, which was from 1/6 to 2/6 on the pound at the time given. Now, Sir this inability in the Government to pay her contracts to the soldier, at the time it could be dispensed with, by him, was the real cause of his losing almost all he had earned in fighting her battles, and from thenceforward, it became a debt due from the Nation to the soldiers which they have never yet received-- they done her work & done it well, and were",soldier,god||poverty,hopelessness||religion

Applicants must produce the best proof the nature of the case will allow, as to the service of the deceased officer or soldier, and the time when he died. It must be clearly shown in what troop or company, and regiment or corps, he served, and the grade he held. Proof, as to service, must be had, either from the records of the War Department, the muster-rolls, the testimony of commissioned officers, or the affidavits of persons of known respectability. Every applicant will make a declaration according to the subjoined form, before a court of record, setting forth, according to the best of her knowledge or belief, the name and rank of the person on account of whose service the claim is presented; the day, month, and year, (of possible,) when he entered the service, and the time when he left the same; and, if under more than one engagement, the claimant must specify the particular periods, and the rank and names of the officers under whom the service was performed; the town or county, and State in which he resided when he entered the service; whether he was drafted, was a volunteer, or substitute; the battles, if any, in which he was engaged; the country through which he marched, with such further particulars as may be useful in the investigation of the claim. From the best sources of information, evidence must be derived as to the period of the death of the officer or soldier. 2. The legality of the marriage, and the time when it took place, must be clearly established; and it must also be shown that the widow was never afterwards married. Record-proof, as to the marriage, is always required, whenever it can be obtained. In a case where the town, county, parish, church, or family records afford no proof as to the period when the marriage took place, the fact must be established by the testimony of one or more respectable persons, whose credibility must be certified by the officer who may administer the oath. And, in order to prevent any mistake or improper use that may be made of the affidavit of an officer who may have the custody of records, from which he may make transcripts of the record, in relation to a marriage, the officer who may give his affidavit will, instead of copying the figures contained in the record, certify ""that it is a true copy of the record, with the exception of the date, which is expressed on the record in fair, legible figures, as follows:"" [bracket] Here copy the day, month, and year, in letters and figures, in exact conformity with the original.

He enlisted later, served as private in Captain John Kirkpatrick's company, Colonel Webb's Virginia regiment, was in several skirmishes in Chesterfield and Cumberland Counties, Virginia, and was discharged sometime after the surrender of Cornwallis. He was allowed pension on his application executed March 8, 1826, at which time he resided in Surry County, North Carolina.

Hargrave recoiled a pace, an exclamation of surprise and alarm- he arrow, in an oblique line downward, had ed within an inch of his face. He looked out no foe was to be seen; and calling to negroes to be on their guard, he hurried to his own particular post, trembling lest ould find his temporary absence had given advantage to his enemies. tily sweeping the top of the wall with his he next looked to the fastenings of the and finding all secure, he drew a long of relief, and resolved henceforth to be watchful and guarded. He then reprimed le, keeping a wary look-out for the en- nd leaning the piece against the stockade, k up another, (he had four altogether) he had placed there after arming the previous to his shooting the savage. d likewise reprimed, and returned to its putting the axe beside it; and then bra- back against one of the palisade posts, nging his favorite weapon into a good po-or a quick aim, he awaited, in anxious the next hostile movement of the r the simpleton, the moment Hargrave left him, he turned to the arrow which had so nearly proved fatal to his benefactor, and the point of which had been driven deeply into one of the logs of the cabin, and drawing it forth, coolly examined it, with an air of idle curiosity. While standing thus, he heard a distant twang, a whizzing sound, and, almost at the same instant, another shaft, with lightning velocity, passed close by his head, and buried its point in the same log as the first, and within an inch of the same spot. ""O-ho, Mr. Savage: is that your game?"" he muttered looking up. ""You shoot from the sky, so you? but you don't stand on nothing, as any fool might know; and so on what you do stand is clearly manifest."" Drawing the second arrow from the log, he quickly advanced to the stockade to avoid further exposure, and followed this round till he came to Hargrave. ""See!"" he whispered, holding out the arrows: ""here are two of Beelzebub's cards, inviting us to a goblin frolic."" ""Tso?"" returned Hargrave, in surprise. ""Yes, Major - one came since you left- but don't let us accept the invitation."" ""Ha!"" said Hargrave, uneasily; ""two arrows shot into the enclosure, and the Indian living to repeat the daring feat! I fear Dick's eyes are not quick and keen enough for his post!"" ""Why, sir, you shouldn't blame Dick for not seeing what is not to be seen"" returned Jacob. ""You were there when the first arrow arrived - did you see where it came from?"" ""Some Indian must have climbed the stockade, and shot it from the top. True, I did not see him - but I think, if I had been in Dick's position, I should have seen him the second time."" ""No!"" said the simpleton, positively; ""no, Major, you would not. I know where the Indian was and is,"" he continued; ""and he was and is where you do not suspect him to be."" ""And where is he then? If you know, speak!"" said Hargrave, quickly. The simpleton was about to give a correct answer, when his hand accidentally rested on the barrel of the rifle that stood leaning against the palisade. Had it been light enough to have seen his features at that moment, the observer would have been struck with the expression of idiotic cunning which they displayed. ""In the air, Major - in the air,"" he said in reply to Hargrave's question. ""Go, Roley - go into the house,"" rejoined the Major, kindly. ""Heaven never made you for such scenes as these - and you will only get killed, without doing us any service."" The simpleton seemed to slink away as Hargrave ceased speaking- but, unperceived by the latter, he carried the rifle with him. As soon as he believed himself entirely beyond the Major's observation, he both laughed and danced, but without making any noise. When he had thus given sufficient vent to his hilarious feelings, he began a seris of operations, the design of which, if design there was, might have puzzled any one of more brains than Jacob to make out. He first crept round to the spot where the arrows had lodged, and, laying his rifle down alongside the cabin, deliberately took off his coat, keeping his person the while as close to the ground as possible. Then placing the coat over the muzzle of the piece, he laid himself flat on his back, and raising the garment high above his head, moved it slowly to and fro, keeping his eyes at the same time on the upper line of the stockage. The ruse was successful; for in less than a minute, an arrow, from an unseen source, pierced the garment, and pinned it to the cabin. We say from an unseen source came the arrow - for he who shot it remained invisible, and not so much as a shadow was seen along the top of the wall. The simpleton, however, seemed perfectly satisfied with the result, and at no loss what to do next. With great caution he removed the coat form the arrow, leaving the latter sticking in the log; and then carefully cocking the rifle, he placed the breach against the cabin, a little back to the gate, and at once felt for the weapon in question. To his surprise, his utter astonishment, he found it on the very spot where he had placed it. ""This is wonderful!"" he said to himself, as he returned to the negroes. but danger was pressing, and he made no further remark to them on the subject. After giving them some instructions in a low tone, the three advanced to the front wall. Carefully withdrawing the block from the loop hole nearest the gate, the Major, exercising the greatest caution, peered through the aperture. Within a few feet of him stood a number of dusky, half-naked savages, all seemingly intent upon their task of hewing down the gate. Perceiving he was not observed, the Major drew back and then slowly and cautiously the muzzles of the three rifles were pushed through the little opening, in an oblique direction. The moment these were fairly brought to bear upon the group of dusky forms, Hargrave, in a tone that was intentionally raised to a perfect yell, cried: ""Fire!"" Like one piece, with a single report, the three rifles belched forth their deadly contents; and four savages, one dead, two mortally wounded, dropped to the earth, with cries of pain. For a moment their companions stood paralyzed with surprise and terror; and then, with screeches and yells, loud and wild, they suddenly bounded away down the knoll, leaving the wounded at the mercy of their foes. It was now that Hargrave, acting wholly from impulse, and with a reckless daring worthy of a madman, threw down his rifle, seized his axe, tore open the gate, rushed out, brained the deserted Indians, gather up their weapons, and bounded into the enclosure, escaping unharmed. All this was the work, as it were, of a single minute; and not till it was over, did the Major fairly comprehend his own fool-hardiness- Then, trembling at the thought, that he had for the time perilled not only his own life, but lives of those he held more dear than his own, he grew weak as a child, and leaned against the stockade for support. ""What a thing is man, when reason loses control!"" he muttered: ""a mariner without a compass - a vessel without a helm."" (TO BE CONTINUED.) Presence of Mind. - the Calders, of Calder, were descended from a brother of Macbeth, to whom, on his assumption of the crown, he resigned the thanedom of Cawdor. They ended in an heir as, Muriella Calder, who was captured in childhood by John of Lorn and the Campbells, whilst walking out with her nurse near Calder Castle. Her uncles pursued and overtook the division to whose care she had been entrusted, and would have rescued her but for the presence of mind of Campbell of Inverliver, who, seeing their approach, inverted a large camp-kettle, as it to conceal her, and commanding his seven sons to defend to the death, hurried on with his prize. The young men were all slain, and when the Calders lifted up the kettle, no Muriella was to be found. Meanwhile, so much time had been gained, that further pursuit was useless. The nurse, at the moment the child was seized, bit off a joint of her little finger, in order to mark her identity, - no unnecessary caution, as appears from Campbell of Auchinbreck's reply to one, who, in the midst of their felicitations on arriving safely in Argyle, asked what was to be done should the child die before she was marriageable? ""She can never die,"" said he, ""so long as a red-haired lassie can be found on either side of Lockame."" John of Lorn and his captive were afterwards married. PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF MARIE ANTOINETTE._- Her precocious beauty elipsed that of Madame du Barry, the favorite of Louis XV., and the modern Phryne. But the beauty of Madame du Barry was that of a courtezan; the beauty of Marie Antoinette was that of a princess. Nature had adorned her with all the gifts that made her, as a woman, an object of admiration , and, as a Queen, an object for adoration; in shape tall, her movements were swanlike in carriage and deportment; in elegance such as to lose nothing of her majesty; her hair was blonde and silken, and its warm tints reminded the beholder of the wavy tresses of a Titian; a lofty oval forehead, like to those of the fair daughters of the Danube; eyes of liquid azure, in which the calm and the tempest of the soul made the look by turns sleep or undulate; the nose slightly aquiline; the mouth Austrian, of her family, that is, a mingling of pride and of a smile; the chin turned up; her color heightened by the chill climate of the north; an irresistible grace shed like a youthful vapor over all her features, and which did not allow her to be viewed but through an atmosphere of fire or of inebriation. -- Larmatine's History of the continent Assembly. down, and how you wondered what people meant by calling the moon ""cold;"" how you wound up your watch half-adfozen times a day, and hadn't the slightest idea whether you were eating geese of grindstones for dinner; how affectionately you nodded to Mr. Brown, of whom her father bought his groceries; how complacently you sat out the minister's seventh-l lie by her side at church; how wolfy you felt if any other piece of broadcloth approached her; how devoutly you wished you were that little bit of blue ribbon round her throat; and how one moonlight night, when she laid her head against your vest pattern, you --- didn't care a in-julep whether the tailor ever got paid for it or not! Now, just imagine her paps, stepping in and deliberately turning all that cream to vinegar; wouldn't you have effervesced? Certainly. See that little army of boots in the entry ouside the doors. May I need a pair of spectacles, if one of their owners has a decent foot! No. 20 turns his toes in, NO. 80 treads over a the side; No. 40 has a pedestal like an elephant. Stay! there's a pair now -- Jupiter! what a high instep! what a temper that man has! wonder if those are married boots? - Heaven help Mrs. Boots when her husband finds a missing button! It strikes me that I should like to mis-mate all those boots, and view, at a respectful distance, the young tornado in this entry, when the gong sounds! Oh, you cunning little curly-headed fairy-footed, dimple-limbed pet! Who is blessed enough to own you? Did you know, you little human blossom, that I was aunt to all the children in creation? Your eyes are as blue as the violets, and your little pouting lip migth tempt a bee from a rose. Did mamma make you that dainty little kirtle? and papa find you that horsewhip? ""Papa is dead, and mamma is dead, too. --Mamma can't see Charley any more."" God bless your sweet helplessness! creep into my arms, Charley. My darling, you are never alone! - mamma's sweet tender eyes look lovingly on Charley out of Heaven; mamma's bright angel wings overshadow ever little Charley's head; mamma and the holy stars keep watch over Charley's slumbers.- Mamma sings a sweeter song when little Charley says a prayer. Going? - well, then one kiss; for sure I am the angels will want you before long. What is that? A sick gentleman, borne in on a litter, from shipboard. Poor fellow! how sunken are his great dark eyes! how emaciated his limbs! What can ail him? nobody knows; not a word of English can he speak; and the captain is already off, too happy to rid himself of all responsibility. Lucky for the poor invalid that our gallant host has a heart warm and true. How tenderly he lifts the invalid to his room; how expeditiously he despatches his orders for an Italian doctor and nurse; how imploringly the sufferer's speaking eyes, are fastened upon his face. Ah! Death glided in at yonder door with the sick man; his grasp is already on his heart; the doctor stans aside and folds his hands - there is not work for him to do; dark shadows gather round the dying stranger's eyes; he presses feebly the hand of his humane host; and gasps out the last fluttering breath on that manly heart. Strange hands are busy closing his eyes: strange hands straighten his limbs; a strange priest comes all too late to shrive the sick man's soul' strange eyes gaze carelessly upon the features, one glimpse of which were worth Golconda's mines to far-off kindred. Now the undertaker comes with the coffin. Touch him gently, man of business; lay those dark locks tenderly on the satin pillow hear you not a far-off wail from sunny Italy, as the merry song at the vintage feast dies upon the lip of the stricken-hearted? FANNY FERN. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST -In November, 1783, Anne, the eldest daughter of George the Second and Queen Caroline, was married, in the Chapel Royal of St. James's, to the Prince of Orange, a man, the hideousness of whose appearance is said to have been only exceeded by some monster in a pantomime, or some ogre in a fairy tale. In giving him her hand, the princess seems to have been entirely influenced by a love of power. ""I would die to-morrow to be a Queen to-day."" she observed on one occasion to her mother. When her father spoke affectionately to her of the ungainliness of her lover's appearance, and told her it was not yet too late to recede - ""I would marry him,"" she said, ""even if he were a baboon."" The subsequent story of the princess and her lover is that of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" over again.

(symbol of hand pointing right) The late snow storm appears to have extended from Maine to Virginia, and embraced a range of territory over three hundred thousand square miles.

Most of them went on snow shoes."" (hand pointing right) Have we any Bonnets Among Us? - The rule now is, to place a little wisp of pasteboard and ribbon so far back upon the head, that the wearer cannot see any part of it. The bonnet patch is secured to the ""philoprogenitiveness"" by a wafer, and the stars look down ""on the place where the bonnet ought to be,"" (hand pointing right) A nephew of Robert burns is Free Church minister, at Dunedin, in New Eealand (sic). (hand pointing right) The New York Tribune thinks that aristocracy does not bear showing up anywhere. Even though it escape negro blood, it stumbles over a cobbler's work-bench, or an old woman's apple stall, and in fact is very ordinary crockery at best. (hand pointing right) The Height of Inconvenience. - There is a man, somewhere in America, who is so tall that he is obliged to run up a ladder every time he brushes his hair. (hand pointing right) Barnes, formerly editor of the London Times, said to Thomas More, that the great deficiency he found among his writers, was not talent, but common sense. Not one of them, he said, can be trusted to write often or long on the same subject, as they were sure to get bewildered with it; and he included himself in this remark.

The log is perfectly sound, and is supposed to be 100 years old. Miscellaneous. Progress of Steam. - In August, 1814, Mr. Niles, the indefatigable editor of the Weekly Register, made an elaborate calculation to show that the grand route from Buffalo, in New York, to New Orleans, a distance of 2,744 miles, might be performed in a steamboat of 500 tons, except between Michigan and the Illinois River, where there was a small obstruction, (since removed.) in thirty-two days and eight hours for the voyage down, and in forty-six days for the passage up! The route from Washington, by way of New York city, Buffalo, Chicago, and St. Louis, to New Orleans, a distance of nearly 8,000 miles, can be traversed in less than eight days! And the return trip does not require ten hours longer time! If our venerable contemporary of 1814 could now revisit the earth, what would be his astonishment at the progress of improvement by steam power! - National Inteliigencer. (hand pointing right) The Law's Delay. - If, in the celebrated arbitration case of Paris and Apple of Discord, the three goddesses - Venus, Juno and Minerva - had been each defended by counsel, we wonder when the case would have come to an end? The apple would have been thrown into Chancery, as a matter of course, and the chances are that the celebrated judgment would not have been delivered at the present day! - Punch. (next column) sell their reservations, and the amount of [illegible] tory they are willing to dispose of; and to get the several tribes to give certain chiefs plenary power to repair at once to Washington, for the purpose of concluding a treaty. Should Col. Gatewood succeed, he is to take the chiefs on with him to Washington to make the treaty.- The district of country which it is proposed to buy from these Indians is about one-half of the reserved land s included within the bounds of the Nebraska territory. It is all that tract fronting on the Missouri River opposite the State of Iowa, and opposite that part of the State of Missouri above the Great Nemaha. - The taking of these Indian chiefs to Washington to form the treaty, looks as though the new system was to be incorporated in its provisions, in expectation of the passage of the bill. - North American. The New Jersey Railroads. - Com. Stockton, in reply to a Committee of the Senate of New Jersey, says the terms upon which the joint companies, (Camden and Amboy Railroad and Delaware and Raritan Canal) will surrender to the State the works of the companies, as follows: - They will transfer all stock of the companies, at the rate at which the last thousand shares of stock have been sold in the market. - The stock consists of 30,000 shares, of which the State now owns 2,000, leaving 28,000 unbought, which at $145 per share, which is about the market rate, would amount to $4,060,000: the debt due by the companies, which would naturally have to be assumed by the State, including subscriptions to Belvidere, Delaware, Freehold and Jamesburg, and Flemington Railroad Companies, would amount to $5,230,000, (bearing interest at six per cent., excepting $1,008,000, which is at five per cent.;) this would make a total of $9,200,000, for which the State would become possessed of all the works. A New Post-Office Delivery. - The Post-Office wagon drove down to the corner of California and Davis streets, on Wednesday, and dumped a load of paper rubbish into a hole at that spot. Some spectators of this apparently unobjectionable proceeding were prompted by curiosity to overhaul the pile of rubbish, and were no doubt very much astonished to find among it a number of letters and papers that should have been delivered somewhere else. We were shown one letter, post-marked New York, Dec. 17 1853, and directed to Santa Clara, which, of course, cam by the Golden Gate mail; also several eastern newspapers, which, from their dates, must have also arrived by the same mail. We were informed by a spectator that several other letters directed to Maysville were also found. This is certainly a very singular occurrence, the result of very culpable carelessness somewhere in the Post-Office Department. We trust the Postmaster will look to it, and prevent its recurrence. - San Francisco Herald. Extraordinary Exhibition. - A curious spectacle (says the Paris Pays.) was witnessed in the great avenue of the Champs Elysees the day before yesterday: - A well dressed person appeared with a great number of bladders, each nearly filled with pure hydrogen gas, covered with a net-work of silk, and attached to his body by means of a strap fastened to a belt beneath his arms. The bladders possessed a sufficient ascensional force to diminish the weight of the man by three-fourths, without lifting him from the ground. This lightened he was able to take leaps of five or six yards at a time with extraordinary rapidity. After descending the great avenue from the quarter Baujon to near the Palais de l'Industrie, he returned in the way he came. A vast crowd followed him, and seemed astounded at his pace. Children born Abroad. - The editor of the American Law Register, in writing on the laws of American citizenship, says: ""It does not, probably, occur to the American families who are visiting Europe in great numbers, and remaining there, frequently, for a year or more, that all their children born in a foreign country are aliens, and when they return home, will return under all the disabilities of aliens. Yet this is indisputably the case; for it is not worth while to consider the only exception to this rule that exists under the laws of the United States, viz.: the case of a child so born, whose parents were citizens of the United States, on or before the 14th of April, 1802.""k Colts' Revolver Beat. - The Boston Daily courier says that there is now in the market a better pistol than Colt's, which is manufactured by, and the property of, the Robbins & Lawrence Company, of Windsor, Vermont. - This pistol is said to be entirely different from any ever before offered to the attention of the public. It is simple in its construction, has a revolving hammer instead of a revolving cylinder, is loaded by unscrewing the barrel, which exposes the chambers, and is not at all liable to become inoperative by corrosion or rust, as all the working parts are contained within the stock or breach, free from any connection with the exploding gas. Sudden Check to Railroad Speed. - It is computed by the Journal of Commerce that the effect of a sudden and accidental stoppage to a railroad train, the cars going at twenty miles an hour, is equivalent to a fall of thirteen feet and a half; at a speed of forty miles, to a fall of fifty-four feet, while fifty miles an hour would give a smash as if we had come from the top of a steeple of eighty-four feet. Passengers may amuse themselves, while travelling, by noting the rate of speed and calculating the chances between getting a fall of thirteen feet and a-half, and one of eighty-four feet, with its possible effect upon the machinery of the cars and their own personal security. Board of Health. - The number of deaths during the past week in this city 280 - Adults 92 and children 138 (next column) burglars early on the morning of the 23rd ultimo. Mr. tiller escaped from the house in order to procure help, and during his absence the burglars shot Mrs. Tiller dead and carried of $400. The Legislature of New Jersey has again rejected, by a decided vote, a bill to charter the Air-Line Railway from New York to the Delaware Bay. The Tayleur Disaster. - From Dublin we learn that the verdict of the Coroner's inquest found that the three hundred and fifty passengers on board the ship Tayleur, were drowned in consequence of the highly culpable neglect of the owners permitting the vessel to leave port without compasses properly adjusted, or a sufficient trial having taken place to learn whether she was under the control of her helm or not. A Buffalo correspondent of the New York Express says that there is no truth in the report that any ""engagement"" exists between Ex-President Fillmore and Miss Porter, of Niagara, as stated from Washington by the Washington gossippers! The Palace of Industry in the Champs Elysees, Paris, which was so immense as to inspire astonishment, turns out to be too small by one-half for its destination. On being measured in every direction, it only offers a surface of 48,000 metres, and the Commission of the Exhibition, in accordance with the Engineers, declares that it can do nothing with less than 95,000 metres. A report has been addressed to the Emperor demanding the authorization to create additions to the edifice. After some hesitation he has accorded it, on the express condition that not a single tree shall be cut down. Caution to Purchasers. - A tradesman advertises that, on receipt of a postage stamp, he will forward, gratis, an illustrated catalogue of his goods, with prices affixed, proving them to be cheaper than those of any other establishment in London. Don't believe a word of it. The mere fact of his asking you to send a postage-stamp proves that he means to stick it on. - London Diogenes. A Splendid Diamond. - The following paragraph in regard to a remarkable diamond found in South America, appears in the money column of the London Times: One of the largest diamonds known was deposited yesterday at the Bank of England, by a London house, to whom it was consigned from Rio Janeiro. Its weight is 251 carats and its estimated value, according to the scale, (pound symbol) 280,000. It is said to be of the finest water, and without flaw, and was found by a negro slave, who received his freedom as a reward. Sea Soundings. - for a year or two pasts, during the summer season, vessels have been kept at sea sounding the depth of the Atlantic Ocean, and in no place has it been found deeper than 1,500 fathoms, 9,000 feet, which is much less than the height of many mountains on the earth. Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, is between 6,000 and 7,000 feet high. A Mohogany Bridge. - One of the bridges built by the Nicaragua Transit company, on the road leading from Lake Nicaragua to San Juan del Sud, is made entirely of mahogany. A cargo of American salted beef arrived recently at Marseilles. The Mayor has published a proclamation on the subject, to the effect that he has tasted it and fins it very good; that it may be had at the extremely low rate of eight cents a pound, and that to render it eatable and to withdraw the overdose of salt, purchasers must soak the meat half a day in cold water. Salt beef must be scarce in that market. Old Times. - The building occupied by the Germantown Bank, at Germantown, Pa., was at one time owned and swelt in by Clarkson, a popular Mayor of Philadelphia, before the year 1793. Also by Dr. Brandt, an eccentric and imaginative philosopher of some note in his day. And during the prevalence of the yellow fever in Philadelphia, in 1793, it was occupied by Thomas Jefferson, and by Mr. Randolph, the Attorney General of the United States. It was also in the garden attached to this building, that the first Paper Mulberry tree was planted, by Mr. Baylie, who for many years, and up to his death, was a clerk in the bank. The tree was brought from the East Indies; and by the time that is real character was discovered, it had over-run a portion of the garden, and required considerable effort to extirpate the young trees. - Daily Register. Wealth of the States. - The population of the States is set down at 25,746,000, and the aggregate personal and real property is estimated at $8,294,560,000. The following are the estimates: New Yrok, $1,112,000,000 Pennsylvania, 850,000,000 Ohio, 710,000,000 Virginia, 6487,000,000 Indiana, 384,000,000 Tennessee 380,000,000 Kentucky, 342,000,000 Massachus'ts 340,080,000 Georgia, 366,000,000 N.

He analyzed the various charges of unconstitutional interference on the part of the Prince, either at the Horse Guards, or with Ministers themselves, by thwarting their advice; and lastly give an emphatic denial to the assertion of his having kept up a correspondence with English Ambassadors abroad. He succeeded in eliciting the sympathies of his hearers for the Prince Consort as an extremely ill-used person, and was loudly cheered by all parties at the conclusion of his speech. The London Advertiser, however, looks upon the refutation as affording indirect testimony of their truth. (next column; the edge of the page is torn, and some words are obscured by this) arrived here from San Francisco, brought on her deck one of the greatest natural curiosities that could be offered to the public. It is nothing more nor less than a section of the great California tree; the largest single tree that has been discovered in the modern Eldorado - the largest in the world. This tree was situated in the south-westerly slope of a hill, in a soil fifteen feet in depth. Its roots extended in all directions for more than fifty rods upon the hill-side, and downwards to the depth of the soil. At the ground its circumference was 92 feet, 4 feet above that it was 88 feet, and 10 feet above 66 feet, and the tapering of the shaft was very gradual and symmetrical upwards for 325 feet to its very top. From actual estimate of its diurnal layers, it is more than 8,000 years since this unparalleled majesty of cedar was a sapling in its teens. Then for a large space on the outer surface next to the bark the rings of growth are so thin as not to be distinguished from each other. The outward dimensions of the main trunk were about the same as the Bunker Hill Monument. From actual measurement it contained more than 300 cords of wood. A vast deal of labor was required to level such a mountain of wood to the earth, and after almost incredible toiling with augers, axes and saws at its foot, it finally fell prostrate, the crash can neither be imagined nor described, the jar of the hill was perceived for miles, as if an earthquake had passed that way. The base having been much burned by the fires of the Indians, it was necessary in order to get a perfect section, to chop the tree entirely through twice. After one hundred and fifty days incessant labor this was effected, and the block of ten feet in length lay severed from the huge pile. But the next thing was to transport such a mass, and by any available means at hand it was apparently as impossible as it would have been to move the hill where it laid. It was finally burned through the centre, the earth was dug away from one end and a fire built underneath, which was left burning for several weeks. The auger hole made a good chimney, which was gradually enveloped by the action of the fire until the men could work inside with their axes. In this manner it was excavated to within about two feet of the outer surface. It was afterwards moved down the levers for more than a mile, then drawn 18 miles by 20 oxen to Mentinut, and then shipped to San Francisco. At San Francisco, only about fifty miles from the place of its growth, it was the greatest curiosity ever exhibited. The whole city of men, women and children flocked to see it. One hundred men could easily stand inside the hollow at the same time, and a six foot man rode a full-sized horse through it without touching his hat to the upper surface. This great curiosity is to be exhibited in this city for a short time before its removal to New York and Boston. - Philadelphia Ledger. Walking on Water. - The perilous experiment of ""walking on water"" was recently repeated, before a concourse of Dublin spectators, by the Hon. Mr. Swift. This gentleman's former experiment, was that of ""walking"" by sea, from Venice to Trieste, a feat by which his life was well nigh forfeited. In repeating the attempt in Dublin harbor, between the Custom House and the Pigeon House Fort he encountered no risk, and was thoroughly successful. His apparatus consists of two air-tight tin floats, twenty feet in length, tapering to a narrow point at each end, and joined together by bars of iron. Standing on the floats, Mr. Swift propels himself by a double bladed oar, which he uses with great dexterity. A Noble-Hearted Wife. - A romantic story of female devotedness has just been circulated at Valence. Is it stated that a Prussian woman, named Hipson, has been working in male attire, as a navvie on the railways, for more than five years. She had an infirm husband and four children; their family were starving she disguised herself, worked hard, and had her wages advanced for her assiduity; with her earnings she supported her pretended ""father"" and ""brothers and sister,"" her husband and her children. When her secret was discovered, gifts poured in upon her from the neighborhood, and work more suited to her sex has been provided. Railroad Collisions. - Two passenger trains recently came into collision on the Columbia road, this side of Lancaster. Some eight cars and five or six engines were disabled. One the passengers, a Mr. Hudson, of Philadelphia and formerly of Lewistown, had both his legs broken, one near the hip, and the other at the ankle. Mr. Wm. Lerk, also of Philadeph had the toes of one foot cut off; and another man had an arm broken. His name could n be ascertained. The Extent of the Storm. - At Porl there was a brisk gale, but no snow. At M treal no storm was felt, and no snow fell. New Bedford the snow fell to about two inches in depth, and travellling was badly peded. At Baltimore and Pittsburg the sn was very deep - not far from two feet. W Cincinnati, Louisville and St. Louis were vis by heavy rains and strong gales, Chicago a Buffalo enjoyed clear and spring-like weath At Cleveland and Columbus snow fell only the depth of two or three inches. A Sensible Woman. - A magnificent do tion has been made by the widow of Ant Arevalo de Alverado, the executrix of her h band, who had designed $25,000 to be given the priests, for masses. She concluded she would better consult the benevolent des and do something more acceptable to the s of God for the salvation of her deceased h by making a different appropriation of the ney; and she has given it to the Hospita Valparaiso.",widow,church||minister||colt||lord||god,religion||animals

This address was well-timed and had a good fect upon the blacks, who promised obe ence, and retired into the dwelling. For an ur longer, the Major stood at the loop-hole, zing out toward the west, his mind busy with housand thoughts of a nature the most asant. By this time the light of the fire s no longer visible; and only the pale rays the moon illumined a scene, which a combi ition of circumstances made appear most oomy to the eyes of the mourning, solitary tcher, who now carefully closed the aper re, and with slow, heavy steps, paced to and beside the lonely grave of his beloved wife. length he turned away, and stealthily entered dwelling, where he found the children leep, and Cuba and Dick stretched out on the or before the dying fire. Without disturbing y one, he took down all the rifles, powder- rns, and bullet-pouches, and with these re- rned to his post. Some three or four hours now passed in a ence broken only by the cheerless hooting an owl, or the distant howl of some hungry olf. The moon now went down, darkness retched it sable pall over the earth, and a ousand bright stars became visible in the ure vault above. It was now the Major felt at vigilance waws most needed - for if the vages were near, and meditating and attack, it is now that they would begin to put their ans in execution. Accordingly, he took a vey of the scene outside - beginning at the uthern loop-holes and ending at the western but without seeing any thing to excite his arm. At the central loop-hole on the western de, he was still lingering, and congratulating mself that his fears of a night assault would obably prove groundless, when his eye chanc- d upon a dark object at no great distance, which o at first believed to be a stump, but which, otwithstanding, he eyed with a strange interest at he could not account for. While looking eadily at this object, he fancied it drew nearer: ertainly it either moved, or his eyes deceived im. With awakened suspicion, he now riveted his gaze upon it, and watched it with breath0- ess attention. He was not long kept in doubt - for, in less han a minute, the dark object had dawn so ear to the stockade that he could no longer see it. What was it? was the next quiry to e settled. Could it be an Indian? If so, it as an Indian creeping upon his hands and nees - for it had not, while in sight, assumed n upright posture. The Major listened, but e could hear no sound. All was still - a gloomy, ppressive stillness - a stillness that seemed oreboding, like that which precedes the burst f a tempest. Stilll keeping his position at the loop-hole, argrave now ran his eyes hurriedly over the m scene, in eager search of some other object give a sad confirmation to his worst fears; t oping the while, with a faint, tremulous pe, that nothing to excite further apprehen- n might be seen. While looking, he heard soft notes of a whipporwill, so close to him, t he fancied the bird must be sitting on the of the palisade above his head. He took a p back, and turned his eyes upward - but hing in the shape of the nocturnal warbler visible on the dark line which the stockade w against the clear sky. REsuming his place he aperture, he again peered through; and he did so, the music of the bird ceased, and dismal hooting of an owl, not quite so near, upon his ear. This continued but a few ments, and then all became as silent as ore. Hargrave now began to indulge the belief t the dark object he had seen was merely ne proling animal, and consequently that ere was no cause for fresh alarm; and he s just on the point of closing the aperture , d turning away, when he was again startled, seeing some ten or twelve moving objects, t unlike the first, within a few yards of him, d all approaching at the same slow pace. e of these objects, ere it drew so close to the ockade as to be to him invisible, suddenly elongated vertically, and displayed the figure of a human being. All hope of danger being distant was now banished - all doubt concering (sic) the objects he had seen was now dispelled. He knew he was surrounded by a band of hostile savages, all eager to begin their bloody work; and he rightly conjectured that what he had believed to be the notes of the whipporwill and ow., were merely the signals of a scout to his dusky brethren, conveying some intelligence by which their first movements were to be determined. Major Hargrave was, in the full sense of the term, a brave man; and one who could bear up unshrinkingly against much that would appal some, who, though of weaker nerve, might prove themselves heroes on the field of battle; but in this terrible moment of grief and danger - danger not only to himself, but to all he loved - he was completely unmanned; and with the first consciousness that a blood-thirsty foe stood within a few feet of him - a consciousness derived at the very point of time, too, when the elastic spring of hope was raising his depressed spirits - he was seized with a violent trembling; and his knees fairly smote together, as did those of the ancient King, Belshazzar, when he saw the spirit-fingers write his destiny on the wall of his palace. Happily, this nervous fear was only of short duration; and then the Major collected his scattered faculties, grew composed, and prepared to act as became one in his situation. Cautiously, carefully, silently, he closed the apertures, gathered up his rifles, etcetera, and, stealthily advancing to the door of his dwelling, pushed it open, without noise, and entered. He found the two negroes still stretched before the fire-place, and his little children asleep on the bed so lately occupied by the cold remains of their dear mother. He bent over them, and, with lips that trembled with deep emotion - for who could say this might not be the last time - pressed a father's warm kiss upon each little upturned face. Then moving away, with a noiseless, step, without disturbing their innocent slumbers, he sought the apartment of Gerturde, and whispered her name. She started up in bed, for dark fancies had kept her awake, and in a low, eager tone, inquired: ""What is it, Edward?"" ""Hush!"" he whispered - ""do not speak above your breath! Try and be firm,"" he continued; ""and, so far as you are able, act the part of a heroine - for you are about to be put to a fearful trial. We are surrounded by a body of savages, of whose numbers I know nothing, and ere long they will begin their attack."" ""Oh, merciful God!"" groaned Gertrude, in horror. ""Hush!"" he again whispered - ""do not let them hear a sound that can make them aware that we are cognizant of their pesence. I am about to go outside again, to render what defence I can, and shall take Cuba and Dick with me. You had better get up and keep the door; but do not disturb Aunt Chloe, or the simpleton, who I trust are asleep above - for neither, in such a time, would be of any service."" He then advanced to her side, pressed his lips to hers, and added, in much agitation: ""Should I fall, let this be our farewell kiss. Should I fall, and you and the dear children escape, be as a mother to them, dear Gertrude - be as a mother to them - and tell them their father died in their defence. There! there! farewell! farewell! and may God have mercy on us all!"" Saying this, he made a hasty retreat, leaving poor Gertude trembling with horror, and more dead than alive. Advancing to the negroes, he roused each with a shake, and said, in a fearful whisper: ""Hush! be silent - not a word - not a breath. Get up and follow me as stealthily as a cat. The least noise may coast you your lives. WE are surrounded by Indians, and nothing but bravery can save us from a horrible butchery. Here is a rifle and ammunition of each of you. I charge you not to speak - scarcely to breath! When we go out, I will station each of you. You must watch with eagle glance, the top of the stockade; and if either of you see a human head rise above it, give it the contents of your rifle. There - come! Come! for delay may be fatal."" Neither of the blacks replied; but both silently arose, trembling with terror, and each mechanically took his rifle and followed the Major. At the south-west angel of the palisade he stationed Dick, and at the north-west Cuba; and as he left each, he grasped his arm, without speaking, and pointed upward, as a sign that he must keep his eyes fixed on the upper line of the wooden wall. This done, the Major, with stealthy steps, repaired to the gate, and placed himself in such as position that he could command a view of one half of the stockade - of all, in fact, that could not be seen by the blacks. Now came moments of painful suspense - of a suspense that seemed to have in it more of horror than the certainty of real action. Minute succeeded minute, and save an occasional movement of some of the horses, not a sound was heard, and nothing to indicate the presence of a savage fore eager for blood. Minute succeeded minute, and a quarter of an hour passed away, and yet all remained still and quiet; and the wondering and expectant Major was beginning to hope that his senses had deceived him - or, if no, that the Indians, finding him so well fortified, had gone to seek other and less guarded victims - when he fancied he heard a slight noise at the gate. Cautiously he drew up to it, and placed his ear against the timbers. No! his sense of hearing had not deceived him. There was a noise here - a very slight noise - noise as of some one slowly and carefully climbing. ""It is as I expected."" thought Hargrave. ""They will first assist one of their number to scale the wall, to reconnoitre and unfasten the gate. t is a perilous venture for him."" He clutched his rifle with an iron grip, set his teeth hard, and, gently cocking his piece, raised it to the position of an upward aid, and then fairly held his breath with anxiety. He had not long, to wait. first one dark, shadowy-looking hand, then another, was seen to grasp the top of the post above him; and then slowly - very, very slowly - a dark, shadowing-looking head and face rose into view. A single moment the Major glanced at the grim, shadowy face along the barrel of his rifle, and then his finger pressed quick and hard against the trigger. A sharp report, and a spasmodic groan, simultaneously followed; and then a dull, leaden sound, as of the fall of some body heavily to the earth. The next moment there arose upon the still midnight air a series of such horrible yells as the bravest have never heard without quailing - yells that sounded as if all the demons of hell had suddenly been let loose; and with the infernal screeches mingled the reports of at least twenty fire-arms, the balls of which ledged in the stout posts of the stockade without doing any injury. For perhaps a minute, these yells and screeches continued without cessation; and then, as suddenly as they had burst upon the ear, they ceased, and the silence without became awfully impressive. CHAPTER XVIII. THE ATTACK. For a few moments after the savage outburst of rage and fury had subsided, not a human sound was heard, as if terror had for the time paralyzed every tongue. Then arose a series of wild cries within the cabin, and voices were heard calling to each other in tones of frenzied alarm. The Major knew enough of the INdian mode of warfare, to feel satisfied that no concerted attack would commence till the latter had taken time to deliberate upon the facts, that their presence was known, that their first attempt to gain an entrance had proved a failure, and that the besieged were armed and resolved to dispute possession with their lives. Accordingly, he reloaded his rifle, even while the demoniac yells of his disappointed foes were ringing in his ears; and then hurried to Dick and Cuba, to see what effect the startling events recorded had produced upon them, and be able to judge what amount of dependence he could place upon them in the moments of greatest peril and sorest need. He found each at his post, watching the upper line of the palisade as he had directed; and though both were much frightened, he rejoiced to perceive that neither would be likely to prove craven-hearted in the hour of dangerous trial. Calling them together, he hurriedly related what had taken place; complimented them on the courage they had displayed, in remaining where he had stationed them, and doing their duty, under circumstances calculated to appal the bravest; and said that with vigilance, caution, and firm resolution, he nothing doubted being able to keep the savages outside the walls, till such time as succor might arrive, or they, becoming weary of the contest, might be glad to raise the siege and depart. ""Remember, boys,"" he continued, impressively, ""all will depend on you. If you stand firm, and act courageously, all may be saved - if you falter, and coward-like, shrink from your duty, we are lost. Yet I will not ask you risk your lives for me and mine without the hope of further reward than the mere saving of your own lives. If, by reason of your good conduct and bravery, we escape from our foes, you, Dick, and you, Cuba, with your wife, shall each and all have you liberty. I promise on my own part, and I take the responsibility of promising on the part of Miss Gertrude, that you shall be set free, to be your own master, and go where you like."" The address of the Major roused the pride of the negroes, who felt they were appealed to as freemen, rather than as servants in bondage; and his offer to make them freemen indeed, touched their finer feelings, and affected them deeply. ""God bless you, Mas'er,"" cried Cuba, ""and Missus Gertrude, and de childrens! I'll do what I can for yo all, de Lord help us! and I's jus' say for myse'f, dat dar was no need ob dat dar compli'tary succumstance ob de liberties, to make dis ole nigger do his best - dar."" (sic) ""'Sider what Cuba says, said for me,"" (sic) chimed in Dick sententiously. ""Well, now, each to his post, and be wary,"" rejoined the Major. ""There is no telling what moment the savages may begin the attack in a body, and we must all be prepared to give them a warm reception. If you have occasion to fire, remember to load your piece the very first thing you do, and as expeditiously as possible. By-the-by, I will provide each of you with a knife and an axe, which will be serviceable weapons should we come to close quarters with the enemy, which God forbid! Will now speak to those in the house - for they know not what has happened, and are in a state of wild alarm and terrible suspense. Saying this, Hargrave hastened around to the front of the cabin, passing three or four horses on his way, which, with heads up and ears erect, were snuffing snorting, and exhibiting other signs of alarm, occasioned by the fearful and unfamiliar sounds they had so recently heard. Making a quick but keen survey of the top of the wall, to be certain that no other Indian had ventured upon the experiment which had cost the first one his life, he advanced to the door, and gave several quick heavy knocks with the breech of his rifle. ""Who is there/"" called out Gertrude. ""Is is I - Edward - all is so far safe - do not be alarmed."" ""Thank God! thank God!"" ejaculated Gertrude: ""I was afraid you were killed. Come in!"" she added, opening the door. As Hargrave was about to comply with her request, the simpleton darted out past him. ""Here, Jacob,"" he called, ""you must remain inside."" If Jacob heard, he did not heed, but turned the corner of the house with a bound, and came nigh receiving the contents of Dick's rifle - who, startled at his sudden approach, and supposing (the next column is mostly torn off, and only a few letters of each line are readable.

Aspinwall & Co., proprietors of the Pacific Mail Steamship Line. She had a fine model, and was considered a very strong craft. The spar and hurricane deck ran the whole length of the vessel. She had a plain clipper bow, and was rigged with two masts, carrying foresaid top-sail, and jibs, with smoke-pipes fore and aft. Her deck length was 285 feet; keel, 280; beam, 41; hold 25; tonnage, 3,000. ""Under a charter from the Government, the San Francisco sailed on Thursday, Dec. 21st, from New York, for San Francisco, purposing to to touch at Rio Janeiro, Valparaiso, and Aca- ment, constituted over 500 men. ""At 9 o'clock, in the words of Lieut. Winder, a passenger on board the ill-fated vessel, on the morning of the 22nd day of December, a tremendous gale sprang up, which increased to a hurricane; and about 12 o'clock at night the engines gave out, and the foremast was carried away. The starboard wheel-house was smashed in by a tremendous sea, and a portion of the upper cabin was stove. This destructive sea swpt away, in a few moments, over 100 souls. The scene on board, from this moment forward, became truly distressing. The lower cabin was crowded to suffocation with passengers, who had rushed there under the impression that it was the only safe portion of the ves- pumps, though worked with vigor, were unable to keep the water from gaining. A temporary steerage apparatus was erected, and some attempts were made to get the vessel under way. But after one or two revolutions of the wheels, the machinery gave out; and it was evident that further exertion in that direction was useless. During all this awful scene, when the passengers were lying soaked in water, expecting the vessel to founder every moment, and fresh disasters and losses of life were every instant announced, nothing could exceed the calm courage with which the officers of the ship performed their duties.

I herewith enclose the Declaration of Mrs. Susannah Cronk, which I do not deem necessary, farther than it shows that she is now living, for when I sent for her to come into court. I did not know that she had before made a declaration, which I find was made and forwarded you some time in the year 1844 from Mercer Co., Pa where Garret Cronk died and from which place the widow followed her son here. I would beg leave to call your attention to the Joint Resolution of Congress of July 1st 1848 “relative to evidence in applications for Pensions,” and would State that Garret Cronk served during the revolutionary in Col. Lees Legion, Virginia Line and that he received a pension until his death of $8.22 1/2/100 per month, as you will see by referring to his pay certificate in your office. I would further state that the widow Cronk is very poor and needy and would respectfully request your immediate attention to her claim. (Illegible) very truly yours Wm. Wynkoop P.S.

You I remember to have pointed out Crosson too, during Court. You also know pretty well the quality of land in the neighborhood of the Court house, his land I am indeed to believe has been the Cause of his being stricken from the Roll of pensions the valuation first made was more than the land would over have sold for it is now scarcely worth being called a home. He is unable to work, and if the word of Col. Triplett of Wilkes County there was few better soldiers than Crosson independent of this he has not been an extravagant man in drink as has been the case with many of the soldiers of the revolution, he was always able to pay his way until about 5 years ago afflictions of body caused him to cease from labor himself his children left him and the failure of a crop he has never been able to get over he has been one of the most industrious men of the age. My being one of his Creditors will not I trust be considered a motive in writing in his praises, for if he never receives a Cent he will never be distressed through or by me, but my knowledge of so many that is now pensioned, some drunkards unfortunate speculators & others of much more property than he possesses is among the inducements I have & his being in actual distress. he never aspired after wealth, more than the labor of his hands all of which I trust will be sufficient inducements",widow,distressed||distress,hopelessness

You say “that the claim of Susannah Cronk, widow of Garret Cronk, has not been allowed in consequence of the failure to produce satisfactory evidence of their marriage prior to 1794”. You also say “Record, or documentary evidence upon this point has been required to bring her claim within the provision of the act of 7th July 1838 and such evidence has not as yet been furnished”. Record evidence there is none, other than what may be gathered from the Bible record of the family of the deceased Garret Cronk, which only implies a marriage by giving the time of the birth of the children, which can only be used as corroborating evidence. At the time of their marriage, it was not customary to keep a record of marriage in the State of New York, and if done, it was only for the private interest of the minister or office performing such ceremony.

Dear Brethren- About twenty-two years since, a few families from New England and this state, opened a settlement in this extensive wilderness under circumstances peculiarly forbidding. With but few exceptions, they were literally poor, from 50 to 70 miles from any market, the roads few and intricate, and at particular seasons impassable. With these discouragements, however, the number of settlers increased to that degree, that in 1807, this church was organised by two missionaries of the cross, consisting of 25 members, who unanimously covenanted to maintain public worship every Lord's Day which they fulfilled. [paper torn] of the administration of the word and ordinances of the gospel, having no ordained minister nearer than fifty miles, __[paper torn] uneasy with their situation, and in 1809 presented a call to their present pastor, who was ordained the following season. [paper torn]__ made for his support, though very honorable to the people, considering their number and embarrassments, were very __[paper torn] exigences, and consequently both parties, in forming and perpetuating the pastoral union, have made sacrifices __[paper torn] cases. __[paper torn] war with all its desolating evils, threatened to devour us. The labors of the field and shop were necessarily __[paper torn]abandoned a families separated some of our best citizens. __[paper torn] country; the public mind continually in agitation from the alternate visits of our own and foreign armies, __ with speculators, thieves, &c. Under such a system of complicated evils, no community can be expected to __ of the world, or religion. the church and congregation, feeble before, was now more feeble; and such were __ of their pastor, arising from this source, that he was induced to ask a formal separation from his people. God, __ interposed; efforts were made for his relief, and he continued his labours. Having struggled with multiplied difficulties, and particularly the expenditures of the state ministry, this people have been unable to erect a house for the worship of God. for many years we have had the occupancy of either the Court House or Academy in this village, for public worship, which have afforded tolerable accommodations, though neither is sufficiently capacious to entertain all the congregation at all seasons. But our privilege in these places is now abridged. As they are public buildings, two other denominations of christians among us, claim the right of occupancy. And although their numbers respectively are small comparatively, yet we have no inclination to deny or retain their privileges and appearances indicate, that if we do not provide some other place for worship, we shall be under the painful necessity of meeting in different sections of the town, at private houses, or in a school room, where not more than one hundred bearers can be accommodated; whereas the usual number of worshippers is about three hundred. At this state of things the church and society have been deeply affected. For several weeks past a most desperate effort has been made to furnish monies for the erection of a church; and contrary to our expectations, the sum of several thousand dollars has been subscribed, to be paid in the produce of the country. A few hundred dollars more in cash will be necessary to purchase such articles as demand cash; and we are perfectly at a loss what course to pursue to obtain it, aside from that anticipated in this address. We are confident that we speak truth when we say, that we have already imposed as heavy a burden upon ourselves, as we are able to bear. To live any longer destitute of house of worship, would not only be trying to our feelings, but detrimental to the interests of truth in this region. To erect a house of small dimensions, would not answer the future wants of this people, as we have an unusual proportion of youth, and the tide of emigration from other places is rather increasing. To solicit alms of any people or individual is humiliating to our feelings; we had rather apply to our own resources, if they were not empty. But we know the object is momentous, and can never be contemptuously treated by any man who honors the tremendous name of him whose power is seen every where, and who, nevertheless, condescends to ""dwell with men on the earth."" We consider also, that notwithstanding the embarrassment of this people, we have annually contributed something for similar objects, and hope we shall have the ability and disposition to increase our charity in future. Our agent, Major Enos Wood, a member of this church and a man in whom we and all patrons may place the highest confidence, is authorised to receive any donation; which, however small, will be gratefully accepted, and sacredly appropriated to the object contemplated in the appeal. With sentiments of love and christian affection, we subscribe ourselves your obedient servants.

Communicated. DIED --In this county on Wednesday evening the 15th inst. at the residence of C. L. Yancy, Esq. Mrs. MARTHA A. WITHERS, late of Culpepper county Va. aged 68 years 7 months and 10 days. Mrs. Withers was born and raised in Faqnier county Va., and resided there the greater part of her life, she then removed to Culpepper and in the fall of 1831 emigrated to Gibson county, Tenn. Mrs. Withers from her youth, had a great deference and respect for religion, and for a number of years, has been a professor of the christian religion, but never attached herself to any church, until the fall of 1834, when she joined the Baptist church at New Hope; and from her pious and upright deportment showed that she felt, as well as possessed ^& professed^, the influence of the Holy Spirit on hers, that she was born of God. In the loss of this matronly and pious lady, the church has been deprived of an exemplary member, society of one of its brightest ornaments, her children of a kind and affectionate parent, and her domestics of a humane and benevolent mistress. Mrs. Withers was aflicted with a long and painful disease, which she bore with that philosophical composure so becoming the christian; and though for the last six months of her life entirely confined to her bed, and unable to move without assistance, she was never once heard to murmur or repine. The writer of this has witnessed several scenes of serenity and composure in a dying hour, but has never beheld any which surpassed that displayed by Mrs. Withers. When asked by a friend how she felt respecting the hour of her dissolution; Ah! said she, ""I am ready."" Although deprived of the power of speech for six [illegible] hours previous to her death, yet she manifested by signs to her friends, that she was perfectly sane. --A beam of tranquility and compromise ^composure seemed to settle on her countenance; and thus she sank, into that eternal sleep of death, appointed for all the living. Such, will ever be the case, with those who have a hope full of immortality.

corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids. 10 Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. 2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd. 3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the Lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. 4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. 5 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. 6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the Lord their God, and will hear them. 7 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the Lord. 8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. 9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. 10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them. 11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. 12 And I will strengthen them in the Lord; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the Lord. 11 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 2 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.",,god||lord||colt||affliction,hopelessness||religion||animals

And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. 8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. 9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. 10 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord. 12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. 13 And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord. 14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 15 And the Lord said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. 16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. 17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. 12 The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel, saith the Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. 2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. 3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it. 4 In that day, saith the Lord, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. 5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the Lord of hosts their God. 6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem. 7 The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah. 8 In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them. 9 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. 11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 13 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 14 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart. 13 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. 2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. 3 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 5 But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. 6 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. 7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. 8 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. 9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The Lord is my God. King James Version 14 Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. 2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 3 Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. 4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. 5 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee. 6 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark: 7 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light. 8 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. 9 And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one. 10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses. 11 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. 12 And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. 13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour. 14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. 15 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague. 16 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. 17 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. 18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness Unto The Lord; and the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar. 21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts.",,lord||god||cattle||sheep,religion||animals

He healeth, and their painful wounds he tenderly up-binds. 4 He counts the number of the stars; he names them ev’ry one. 5 Great is our Lord, and of great pow’r; his wisdom search can none. 6 The Lord lifts up the meek; and casts the wicked to the ground. 7 Sing to the Lord, and give him thanks; on harp his praises sound; 8 Who covereth the heav’n with clouds, who for the earth below Prepareth rain, who maketh grass upon the mountains grow. 9 He gives the beast his food, he feeds the ravens young that cry. 10 His pleasure not in horses’ strength, nor in man’s legs, doth lie. 11 But in all those that do him fear the Lord doth pleasure take; In those that to his mercy do by hope themselves betake. 12 The Lord praise, O Jerusalem; Zion, thy God confess: 13 For thy gates’ bars he maketh strong; thy sons in thee doth bless. 14 He in thy borders maketh peace; with fine wheat filleth thee. 15 He sends forth his command on earth, his word runs speedily. 16 Hoar-frost, like ashes, scatt’reth he; like wool he snow doth give: 17 Like morsels casteth forth his ice; who in its cold can live? 18 He sendeth forth his mighty word, and melteth them again; His wind he makes to blow, and then he waters flow amain. 19 The doctrine of his holy word to Jacob he doth show; is statutes and his judgments he gives Israel to know. 20 To any nation never he such favor did afford; or they his judgments have not known.

However, since numerous inquiries have been made relative to the schedule of property of the Revolutionary War soldier Luke Stansbury, it is presumed he might be the soldier in question. In the Revolutionary War pension claim of Luke Stansbury (W.165) he stated in April 1824 that he had no income other than the schedule he named which was - one mare, one cow, and calf, four hogs, some chairs, some household furniture, some tools, but no land of his own.

He was at Ash [illegible], Woodbridge Short-hills - Millstone & Boundbrook. He performed duties under Capt. McKoy along the Raritan & Millstone rivers. He was out on duty when the Pennsylvania troops revolted. I know he was in the public service as a soldier, under his company officers, every year after our marriage, until the war ended, & several months in each year. _ Beside his service under Captain Baily for 5 months. I sincerely believe he did not perform less than three months duty in any one year of the war, & that in the two first years after his five months service, he performed not less than four months service in each year: making all together, not less than 25 or 26 months of active faithful service. _ He was always called. Sergeant Kinnan, & I only believe he was a Sergeant throughout the war. He always wore upon his shoulders, tassels, or some badge, which privates did not wear, & which it was said, belonged to Sergeants. _ After the war closed, I lived with my husband in Baskingridge, till the year 1787, when we removed from New Jersey to Western Virginia, & settled on Tigers valley river, a branch of the Monongahela. In the year 1791 [inserted, two words:] May 13th the Indians fell upon us [inserted, two words:] at night murdered my husband & one child on the spot, badly wounded another child, & this child, a boy, older than the other, escaped. I was carried off by them a prisoner. When I was dragged out of the house, my infant had just been scalped, & lay gasping on the floor. _ My boy who escaped, has since been a soldier in the last war of 1812-- was wounded, & now is an invalid pensioner, under the name of Joseph Kinnan. _ I was carried a prisoner thro the wilderness, & remained a prisoner during 3 years & 3 months, on the Maumee river, near fort Wayne, from where I contrived to make my escape, & by the aid of a brother. I finally returned to my friends in Jersey, where I have lived till this time. _ The family bible, which contained a family record of the age of myself husband, as well as of the childen, was destroyed when my husband & children were massacred. I have never married since the massacre of my husband Joseph Kinnan, by the Indians. I am still his widow, am destitute, & poor, & aged, & not able to do much labor, were it not for kind friends, I know not how I should be supported, unless by the public. I humbly ask my Country for a pension, on account of the long & faithful revolutionary services of Joseph Kinnan, my decd husband, for whom I have often filled his knapsack with provisions & clothes, whilst he was cleaning his musket, to meet the enemy. Most of my husbands comrades in the revolution, have gone to the grave, & I fear I shall be able to find but few living witnesses of his militia services. _ Mrs Tone, a former nieghbor & friend of my youth, daughter of Capt McKoy, is living in Morris town, & Isaac Bedell also, who knew my husband in the war.

It is a well known fact that Lord Howe, the Commander of the British Army, established his headquarters on the Heights of Staten Island, which overlooks a very considerable extent of country, including the Township of Woodbridge, the residences of the two aged applicants. That he held this position until April 1783, being separated from New Jersey only by a narrow channel of water called The Sound, which was in 1780-81 frozen over and passable for large teams & heavy artillery. Hence, it became necessary for the people living on that frontier, and in such proximity to the enemy, to be always on the alert, as they were constantly subject to alarm and annoyance by the British & their more dangerous & inveterate enemies, the Tories of their own state. The families of both these applicants suffered many privations, and were special objects of revenge in consequence of their firm adhesion & patriotic devotion to the American cause.

The next is the Times, a very good family horse, of an easy gait and good bottom. Occasionally he starts before the tap of the drum, but is generally manageable. He has been lately brought into the stable however, and we do not know enough of him yet to trust him entirely out of sight. This prancing courser we have never been able to break; his name is Enquirer, and as strange a nag he is as ever wore bit and saddle; he is a wayward beast: for one mile heats he does very well, but for bolting, running away, throwing his rider, and all sorts of villanons pranks, he beats the d--l. He has bottom enough, and spirit enough, and we hope to get him manageable, but shall have a job of it. The Commerecial, standing along side of him, is an old horse, who, though not the strongest in the stable, is kind in harness, and for a steady jog answers a very good purpose. The Statesman, as you see, is a clever nag, and for common use is not bad; great speed can be got out of him when he has both his riders: one of them is away: when he returns, we intend pushing him hard upon the course. ""This,"" said he, pointing to a ninth, ""is one of the oldest horses in the stable, and for hard service an thorough work, is in spite of his years more to be relied upon than any of the stud: the Post for that is his name, is one of those crow, k[illegible] horses, that very often runs away wi[illegible] unskilled rider, but when kindly treate[illegible] ied upon for a long journey. [illegible] the American, is as you see a [illegible] well built animal and [illegible] saddle answers very well: fashionable [illegible]ades are fond of riding him: his carriage is easy and graceful. He shows his teeth occasionally, but seldom bites. He has not quite the bottom of the Post, and is hardly as secure in bad travelling: he is a fair horse though, and when a little older will run against the field."" My attendant was then going on to speak of a number of colts; but I was obliged to hurry off and hear his story another time. N.Y. Times A Nose for an Arm. That class of people in New Jersey who are very particular about the etiquette of fashionable life, have a habit, when inviting their guests at table to help themselves, of saying, ""Make a long arm."" A good woman of this unsophisticated class, having one day a Scotchman to dine with her, who had an exceedingly long nose, could not help taking particular notice of that distinguished member of her guest's face, and as the enormous pro[illegible] was naturally uppermost in her thoughts, when she would have said, ""Make a long arm,"" she was unfortunate as to say, ""Do make a long nose, Sir."" -- ""A lang nose, quotha!"" replied the Scotchman, ""I thought in a' conscience, gude woman, ye wad be content wi' the ane I ha."" Of catching Yankees! There is an old black woman at the Hayana, known to almost every one who frequents that port, as a washer of clothes, in which business she employs several slaves, having acquired a handsome property by it. She is partial to the Americans, having made the greater part of her money through them. When some of the British ships stopped there on their way for the coast of Louisiana, she, as usual, boarded the ships in search of business and having despatched that, she asked the captain of one of the 74's, ""Where are you going massa?"" who replied, ""We are going to catch some d--d Yankees at N.

It has however been gone, or lost, for many years, as well as all his various papers & books of public accounts, none of which have I seen for many years. It is probable his papers & accounts were all given up after the war, to the proper officers appointed to settle them.

I was married by Revd Joseph Groon, Minister of the Gospel of the Presbyterian Church at Parsippany Morris County. The precise day of the marriage, I cannot tell, having lost my family record, which was contained in an ancient family bible, now mutilated & worn out, with many of its leaves gone, & the family record entirely lost, & has not been supplied. There is no record of marriages of that early period in the Parsippany Church, as I am informed & verily believe, nor are there any persons who were present at our manage, now living, to my knowledge. My husband entered upon his duties as Commissary or Quarter Master, soon after the birth of my oldest child, Catharine, & from that period, was absent from home upon his public duties the greater part of his time. My said husband, the aforesaid John Stiles, died at his residence in Pequannock township on the 23d day of October 1830, & I have remained his widow to this day, as will more fully appear by testimony hereto annexed.

We had cruised off Cape Henry for about two months when we returned to Hampton Road, we were attached by the British Ship ""Perseverance"" and after a short engagement in which our vessels were both disabled, we were captured. In this action, the marines of our ship never came into engagement owing to our *** and rigging being so much cut away. Three men were killed on board of our ship one of whom was Captain Bell's clerk by the name of Bussey and several wounded. We were immediately carried on board of the ""Perseverance"" and put in the hold and sailed to Long Island below New York where we were transferred to the British Prison Ship the ""Old Jersey"". Here we were confined twelve months wanting one day where we endured incredible suffering. We were taunted, insulted and put upon and maltreated in almost every imaginable way. Numbers died for the want of the necessary sustenance of life and others from sickness proceeding from the manner of our treatment, besides this as many as 6 or 7 of my acquaintance to my knowledge died after their release as I suppose from exposure to the open air after having been confined so long to the gloomy hole of that horrible vessel. Among these I remember the names of Benjamin Howard, Richard Jourdan, and William James all from the same neighborhood with myself. Captain Bell did not remain long with us but was paroled on his honor. Captain Bussey was likewise paroled. When we were released, it was by the influence of two Quakers by the name of John Mason and William Bull who each had a son confined on the prison ship. As well as I can remember, these Quakers procured the release of all with whom they were acquainted amounting to almost forty. We were released upon our parole. And so, this declarant states by way of recapitulation that he served 2 months as a volunteer at Wilmore's Ferry, 2 months at Baltimore, 2 months as an enlisted marine on board the ""Jolly Tar"" and 12 months was a prisoner on board the ""Jersey"" prison ship.",soldier,suffering||bull,hopelessness||animals

State of New Jersey, County of ['Hunterdon' and 'Morris' crossed out] Morris SS: On this 24th day of December, Anno Domini 1839, personally appeared before the Court of Common Pleas of Morris County aforesaid, Mary Stiles, a resident of Pequannock township Morris County, N. Jersey, aged 86 years, who being first duly sworn according to Law, doth on her oath make the following declaration, in order to obtain the benefit of the provision made by the act of Congress passed July 4th 1836:- I am the widow of John Stiles, who was, as I believe, an Issuing Commissary of provisions in the militia of Morris County New Jersey, & served in the war of the revolution, from its beginning in 1776 to its end. It is probable that I may have mistaken the title by which my husband, the said John Stiles was known when upon actual duty; & I admit that I do not know myself, what his proper Military title was. I believe he was sometimes called Quarter Master, & Continuous Commissary. His duties as far as I understood them in the time of the war, consisted in distributing provisions to the Militia troops when they were in service at the various places where they were ordered, & also to purchase & collect from farmers, & wherever provisions could be bought. He was absent from his family almost all the war. When he was not following the soldiers in their marches from place to place, was attending them when in camp or at quarters, he was out buying & collecting provisions for their use. His purchases consisted of Beef, pork, flour, Grain &c. He was a man of considerate property, with a good farm, well stocked with cattle, & money at command, & often when not furnished by government with means, he bought supplies for the Militia with his own means, & often upon his individual credit, & in this way & by means of continental money, I believe he lost a large proportion of his Estate.- I do not believe it will be in my power to specify or particularize in detail the various services of my said husband-- stating under whose particular command he acted, the various places to which his duty called him, or down he was engaged at any one point. I have heard him often speak of General Winds, Colonel Munson, Colonel Seely, Colonel Hathaway: Captain Minn, Bates, Ward, Baldwin & others, under whose command he acted, furnishing & distributing provisions to troops commanded by them, at different times & places. How many teams & wagons loaded with supplies were under his direction, I cannot tell his own team & wagon were almost constantly out, either collecting or distribution, & I believe he often hired & employed others for the public service; & when money was short & public & private and it both failed, he often recd. orders, forcibly if necessary, to take grain & meat to prevent the soldiers on duty from suffering. In the performance of his public duties, he was, as I believe, engaged by order of some of the before named officers, often at Elizabeth town, at Newark, at Morristown, Quibble town, New Brunswick, Amboy, Monmouth, Pompton, Springfield, Connecticut farms- Hackensack, Aquahanack & other places not recollected.

I was quite a young man when I first became acquainted with him. I saw him leave Lancaster and join the Army as a drum Major in 1778. The first battle he was engaged in was at Monmouth in New Jersey. He had been at Valley forge under Washington shortly before. In 1780, he was marched under Gates to Clermont in the South They were attacked by the British under Lord Cornwallis, and were defeated on the road to Camden. Gen. Green afterwards took command of the Army. He was with Green during 1781 and 1782 and was discharged early in 1783. The old man in his lifetime, and other soldiers who were with him in the Revolution, told me of their services as above stated. McEwen mentioned many circumstances that occurred during the war. The hardships he endured and the long fatiguing marches. He was always considered by the people of Lancaster as a Revolutionary Drummer, and was a man of high respectability. In 1775, he went as a Drum Major in Gen. Haynes' army under Capt. [illegible]. I also went out in the same Regiment in this campaign. He told me many of his exploits during the war - how he escaped from the British, etc. - which he had told me shortly after his return from the Revolutionary War, many years before.",,lord||hardships,hopelessness||religion

Although I sent you Mary Stiff's declaration at first, yet I thought I might as well have it taken in part over again, as she made a mistake in the former one in regard to the death of her Father. This declaration, and that of her sister, who at the only daughters and heirs now living, state the exact time of the death of both their parents, as taken from the bible in the possession of Mrs. Sarah Stauffer. As much as I regret that there is no witness now living, who went out in the war, and endured the trials and hardships of a long campaign with James McEwen - yet I know the Department will find pleasure in seeing that the Witnesses testify, beyond all doubt, that he deserted from the British ranks and joined the American forces, immediately married an American lady ([illegible], Mary Stiff's) and served until the conclusion of the War. Jacob Gerber, a former Witness, testifies that he knew him well, and often heard him relate his revolutionary marches to him, while they were out on duty in the War of 1796, and then old Mr. Gonter, who is still in the enjoyment of all his faculties, and whose private character is above all reproach, testifies to his being out and in service in the Pennsylvania Line, and that he was received as a Revolutionary Soldier in his lifetime. And then the Hon. Emanuel Schaeffer, Judge of the Court, who knew old Mr. McEwen well, certifies that he was reputed to be a soldier of the Revolutionary War. And Captain G. Musser, who is an Alderman of the City, certifies as to the common impression among the people as to the reputation of McEwen's Revolutionary claims. The reason why he was spoken so much of as being a revolutionary Soldier was on account of his having deserted the British so soon as he had an opportunity after he had landed in America. In your letter you requested me to have the Court to certify as to the death of James McEwen and his widow, also to the name of her administrator. This the court said it could not do, as the records did not show it, and the only exact knowledge was from the Declaration of Mrs. Stiff and Mrs. Stauffer, which I am sure will satisfy the Department. Neither could his honor certify who was her administrator because there never was any appointed. But when the Department grants the claim, I will have Mrs. Stiff or Mrs. Stauffer or both of them (if necessary) to take out Letters of Administration, so as to be able to draw the claim, as in your letter you say it payable to her administrators as assets. Under the Regulations you sent me, I see that when the declarant swears that there is no witness living, a reputation of being a Revolutionary soldier will be great weight, and I am happy that the present papers contain strong and conclusive traditionary testimony. Please see the former papers I forwarded you for particulars. Pardon me for troubling you with so long a letter, for I thought it proper to explain the case to you so as to facilitate you in a speedy examination.

He accordingly complied with the Commissioner's instructions, and presented the surgeon's certificate and evidence of the fact, in conformity thereto, showing the time when the disability occurred, (the 10th of December, 1824;) and, upon a re-examination of the case, on the 17th of June, 1837, the Commissioner discovered ""the law which authorized him to increase the pension had expired,"" and declined to increase the pension on that sole ground, every thing else being in the petitioner's favor, and satisfactory to the Commissioner, and within the spirit and letter, true intent and meaning of the then late law.

Must here state, whether a revolutionary soldier, or officer, or pensioner, naming the State where the pension was paid: or if the husband served and died in the service during any war since 1780 -- naming them thus: Wayne's, or Indian wars prior to 1800; War with Great Britain, 1812; Seminole War, 1817 and 1818; Black Hawk War, 1832; Florida War, 1835 to 1842; Cherokee and Creek Disturbances, 1836, &c.; Mexican War, 1846 to 1848; and giving the name of the Captain, Company, Regiment, and Colonel: and whether militia, volunteers, or regular army and place of muster, discharge, or death. 3.

Name of the minister, or justice of the peace; and if married in any State or county where any public records of marriages are kept, the marriage should be proved by a duly certified copy of the record, or by the testimony of credible witnesses who were present at the marriage; and where such testimony exists, and is not produced satisfactory reasons must be stated, under oath, why it is not produced; and, in all cases where record evidence of the testimony of witnesses who were present at the marriage could be procured and is not, the claim will be rejected, unless other testimony of a very full and satisfactory character is produced. If it is shown by affidavit that no record evidence or testimony of witnesses can be procured, the claimant may then produce the best other evidence in her power. such as the testimony of witnesses, who were acquainted with her and her husband during his lifetime, knew them to live together as man and wife, and that they were reputed to be, and that the fact of their having been married was never called in question by their acquaintances. In no case, however, will the mere statement of the witnesses, that the claimant is the widow of the deceased, be taken as evidence of the marriage; but the witnesses must state the facts and circumstances from which they derive their knowledge or opinion that she is the widow of the deceased. A certificate from the clergyman or magistrate who solemnized the marriage is not competent evidence, unless the genuineness of the certificate be proved, and the person who gave it be shown to have been authorized to solemnize marriages. 9. This blank is left, for the purpose of the applicant's stating whether any bounty land or pension has at any time been received by any one; if so, by whom, and when. 10. Naming the war. All records or copy of records must be attached to the original declaration by a tape, the ends of which must pass under the seal of the court, in order to prevent the improper addition of any evidence after the papers have been duly executed and certified to by the judge and clerk. If the widow was re-married, all the facts of marriage and death of second husband must be proven. A probate court is the most convenient court in which to make these proofs.

Johnson Clerk ------------------------------- 25,400 Claim of Elizabeth Smalley FOR A PENSION widow of Isaac Smalley ACT OF FEBRUARY 3, 1853. War of Revolution F.E. HASSLER, ATTORNEY Washington City, D.C. NOTES. 1. Which must be made before a judge of a court of record in open court, unless applicant is from bodily health unable to appear; it then can be made before the judge, who will certify to the fact of the disability to appear. 2. Must here state, whether a revolutionary soldier or officer, or pensioner, naming the State where the pension was paid or if the husband served and died in the service during any war since 1790 -- naming them thus: Wayne's, or Indian wars prior to 1800; War with Great Britain, 1812; Seminole War, 1817 and 1818; Black Hawk War, 1832; Florida War, 1835 to 1842; Cherokee and Creek Disturbances, 1836, &c.; Mexican War, 1846 to 1848; and giving the name of the Captain, Company, Regiment, and Colonel; and whether militia, volunteers, or regular army; and place of muster, discharge, or death. 7. Name of the minister, or justice of the peace; and if married in any State or county where any public records of marriages are kept the marriage should be proved by a duly certified copy of the record, or by the testimony of credible witnesses who were present at the marriage; and where such testimony exists, and is not produced, satisfactory reasons must be stated, under oath, why it is not produced; and, in all cases where record evidence of the testimony of witnesses who were present at the marriage could be procured and is not, the claim will be rejected, unless other testimony of a very full and satisfactory character is produced. If it is shown by affidavit that no record evidence or testimony of eye witnesses can be procured, the claimant may then produce the best other evidence in her power, such as the testimony of witnesses, who were acquainted with her and her husband during his lifetime, knew them to live together as man and wife, and that they were reputed so to be, and that the fact of their having been married was never called in question by their acquaintances. In no case, however, will the mere statement of the witnesses, that the claimant is the widow of the deceased, be taken as evidence of the marriage; but the witnesses must state the facts and circumstances from which they derive their knowledge or opinion that she is the widow of the deceased. A certificate from the clergyman or magistrate who solemnized the marriage is not competent evidence, unless the genuineness of the certificate be proved, and the person who gave it be shown to have been authorized to solemnize marriages. 9. This blank is left for the purpose of the applicant's stating whether any bounty land or pension has at any time been received by any one; if so, by whom, and when. 10. Naming the war. All records or copy of records must be attached to the original declaration by a tape the ends of which must pass under the seal of the court, in order to prevent the improper addition of any evidence after the papers have been duly executed and certified to by the judge and clerk. If the widow was re-married, all the facts of marriage and death of second husband must be proven. A probate court is the most convenient court in which to make these proofs. The law (3d February, 1853 ) grants pensions to the widows of revolutionary soldiers, without reference to date of marriage who served six months and over. as",soldier,minister||clergyman,religion

My impression at first, was, that there were Some difficulties facts in the way of her procuring a pension from the records in the several acts of Congress relating to widows pensions, but from the construction of that act, and more particularly, the late act of Congress had removed those difficulties- As I know thereon some niceties required, I herein give you a sketch of her case, and ask you to let me know from the circumstances, any the evidence she can address, whether she can obtain a pension also please send me a copy of the regulations adopted by the Pension Office relating to the application for pensions. She can testify herself to the day any year of her marriage by whom the marriage ceremony was performed, and that she has never since been married. Her marriage, she thinks, was recorded in the church records, but not any other place, that that church is not any longer in existence, and can conceive of no one in that region (Massachusetts), who may be likely to have these records, even if they were yet in existence. She has the Revolutionary claim granted by the war department, in 1818, signed by J.C. Calhoun as Secretary of war numbered 3070, to her late husband, who it appears was a private in the Revolution, She is also able to prove by her neighbors here, that she was reputed to be his wife, that he so spoke of her and to her, and also prove the children the declarations of her husband, (some of her child are near 50 year of age that she was his wife, &c, but no family record has ever been kept by him, or any one else to her knowledge, and she knows of no record of the marriage, unless one was made by the officiating minister, and she cannot determine, whether it was usual for that church to keep a record of marriages or not, nor does she know of any one now living, that was present at the marriage, Now I know not what to the war department has adopted in regard to the evidences of marriage de facto, but would rather be of the opinion that she would be able to produce evidence that would come within the requirement of any reasonable rule though none other that I know of, than as express above. There is no doubt of her being the wife de facto, as well as de jursof the late John Gaylord, they have lived in this town several years ten, or more I think, and came from Massachusetts directly here with several of his children",widow,church||minister,religion

State of Maryland Frederick County, Frederick Court Session. On the 21st day of March 1843, personally appeared before me Richard H Marshall, one of the Associate Judges of the Fifth Judicial District of Maryland, Mary Greentree, alias Marshall, a resident of Frederick County and of Frederick town, and by reason of bodily infirmity and unable to appear in open court, aged 81 years on the 15th day of April 1843 – who being first duly sworn according to law doth on her oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the pensions made by the act of Congress passed July 7, 1838, entitled an act generating half pay and pensions to certain widows. That she is the widow of Benjamin Greentree, alias Benjamin Marshall, who received a pension in his lifetime as a revolutionary soldier for proof of which services and pension she refers to said petitioner and its evidence now on record in the pension office at Washington. She further declares that she was married to that identical petitioner Benjamin Marshall as he is therein called alias Benjamin Greentree at George town, then in Montgomery County by the Reverend Stephen B Balek on 8 October 1786, as appeared by the family record cut from the family Bible on 20 March 1843, and to which marked A. She refers as proof of her marriage aforesaid – that said record is in the handwriting of her late husband altogether – that it contains a correct list of her children and their ages, which she had by said Benjamin Marshall, alias Greentree, the identical petitioner aforesaid, who was always called and known in this county as Benjamin Greentree when he was receiving his pension as Benjamin Marshall, he having at the time of his enlistment append the name Marshall to gratify a gentleman of that name, with whom he then settled and in this way was entered on the roles as Benjamin Marshall. She has no further said proof of her marriage as aforesaid. For the reasons stated in paper marked B. Several persons were present when she was married aforesaid, but all have either died, or emigrated to parts of the country where, if alive it would be impossible for her to find them. She has never heard of them since their removal, which was a great many years since, (this is the start of page 24) and believes all to be dead. She further declared that her aforesaid husband Benjamin Greentree (alias Marshall) died in Frederick County within 2 miles of Newmarket on 29 March 1839 and that she was not married to him prior to his leaving the service, but the marriage took place previous to the first day of January, 1794 … at the time al.. stated.

Joseph Cheuvront who died at his home near West Milford, Harrison, County, Virginia, (now West Virginia) March 25, 1832. Since it has pleased God to Deprive me of the power of speech, I bless His Holy Name that I enjoy my mental faculties; my fingers can communicate my wishes on the slate. I address this to you, my children, as a memento which I request each of you to transcribe and keep for future generations. I was born in the city of Strasburg [Strasbourg] in the Empire of France on the second [2] day of February, 1755, was reared in the city of Nantes and received my education when very young. In the year 1771, in the fifteenth [15th] year of my age, I went to England where I remained until 1774, when I embarked for America and landed at Fredricksburg, [Fredericksburg] Virginia, in 1778. I was converted to God in the year following. I united my self with the despised Methodists and by them have been employed in various stations 9viz.) as class-leader, exhorter, steward, local preacher, travelling preacher and presiding Elder, in all of which I have, I believe, given satisfaction to my brethern [brethren]. I have now been in the church fifty-three [53] years and have never had a charge brought against me. I do not say this to boast, but to stimulate you to support and maintain a good character. In the year 1781, at the siege of Yorktown, God delivered me from all tormenting fear and gave me two [2] seals to my ministry. I have filled some important stations in the state, in all of which I have endeavored to establish mine and your character. I have tried to be to you a father and through great difficulties, I have raised you to be what you are. I have often conselled [counselled] you and have endeavored to set good examples before you, yet some of you who profess religion are, I fear, very superficial and luke-warm. I am going to leave you. Must I leave you in the hands of the wicked one? May the Good Lord hear and answer my prayers in your behalf. Try to set the fear of God before your eyes. Do not grieve one another. Live in peace and love together. Be good to your mother, and do not lay anything in her way that might distress her. This is the last advice of your dying father. I now bid you farewell. I am truly resigned to the sufferings I experience.",rejected,god||church||lord||distress,hopelessness||religion

The said Willson has shown me a me a furlough signed by John Lamb Coll. the hand of Coll Lamb was very familiar to me and I have no doubt it is genuine. I therefore have concluded that Willson must have belonged to Coll Lambs Regiment, and also that he was honourably discharged as there was no desertion as late as the date of the furlough. I feel assured that if a correct roll of Capt Samual Lockwoods Company afterward commanded by Capt William Stevens of Lambs Regiment can be found, that the name of David Willson will be found on it. And I am the more confident in this opinion from having conversed with a person transiently in the City of New York, who belonged to the said Regiment, who informed me that he remembered the name of Willson in the said Company. Willson according to his account, immediately after his discharge, went into the Western part of Pennsylvania, and never has received his Land, and of Course he is not on the Register of Persons having received Land - He now appears to be an upright & needy old Man -.

MR. EDITOR - By giving the following a place in your widely circulating paper, you will confer a favour on the friends of the deceased, and perhaps furnish a useful hint to come of your numerous readers. CAPT. JOHN MAPP, the subject of this notice was born in Virginia, about the year 1759. From thence his father, Littleton Mapp, moved to South Carolina about the commencement of the revolutionary war, where he suffered much from those who were opposed to the liberty of this country. John was active in the defence of his country, and although not more than nineteen years of age, he was promoted to the rank of captain in the army, which office he filled with credit until the close of the struggle for independence. He married the daughter of Col. White, and in 1792 emigrated to Georgia, there he and his companion sought for and obtained the peace and joy of the gospel of Christ. In 1794 they united themselves to the Methodist Episcopal church, of which he continued a useful member until his death. He had been for many years a class steward, and was liberal in the support of the gospel, as also kind to the poor. Brother Mapp had enjoyed good health for many years for a man of his age. On Sabbath morning the 23d of March, he went out to church in good health; in the class meeting he said he still felt as much or more than ever determined to hold out faithful to the end of life; a little time after he felt a pain in one of his teeth and in a moment after in his breast-he then rose, spoke to his wife and they went out, when it was ascertained that he was very ill. Medical aid which was at hand was baffled in every attempt to restore him. He verbally made some distribution of his property. His wife bathed in tears inquired of him what his future prospects were, when he replied with all that confidence and composure that bespoke his entire resignation to the will of God; that his way was clear and that he had no objections to going. By this time preparations were made and he was carried to a house near at hand and laid on a bed, from which, in a few seconds his spirit took its flight (we humbly trust,) to the land of rest. Thus in the short space of an hour's warning he was numbered with the pale nations of the dead, and his spirit ushered into eternity. On Monday the 24th, his remains were removed to his own garden, followed by a number of weeping friends, and there interred to await the resurrection of the just. Oh how uncertain is life! R. SMITH.

I therefore hired a man to take my place who was at that time bound to serve as a servant for seven years for which I gave the enormous sum of nine thousand pounds of tobacco which amount by the assistance of my friends I actually paid and was then of having the liberty of remaining with, and labouring for my wife and children. But contrary to my expectation, I was immediately enrolled with the militia and ordered on guard and marched to Sandy Point on the Potomac River under Captain Daniel Morgan and Lieutenant William Atwill where we continued to the best of my recollection 5 months from thence we marched to Peckalone where we stayed 2 months from thence to Baileys warehouses where we stayed 5 months from thence to Momony ferry where we stayed one months under Captain George Garner from thence back to the Rapahanock River where I was placed under Captain Harrison for 2 months. I was then ordered down to the siege of Wallis at Yorktown but in consequence of a desparate rising under my right arm I was examined by Captain Harrison and sent home as being entirely unfit for duty where I remained for several months unable to render any service to myself or family during the aforesaid time of duty I served under command of three different colonels.

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS. COUNTY OF WORCESTER, ss. ON this fourteenth day of August in the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and thirty two personally appeared in open Court, before Nathaniel Paine Esquire, Judge of Probate for said County of Worcester now sitting at Worcester, Elijah Warren a resident of Leicester in the County of Worcester and Commonwealth of Massachusettes, aged seventy three years, who being first duly sworn according to law, doth on his oath make the following declaration, in order to obtain the benefit of the act of Congress, passed June 7th 1832. THAT he entered the service of the United States under the following named officers and served as herein stated. He was born in Leicester in said County of Worcester on the 27th day of August 1758, and will be seventy four years old if he lives to the 27th instant, and has always lived in said Leicester. In November 1775, a certain number of militia men were called for from Leicester, and this declarant was one of the members, that turned out. He can not recollect the day of the month, but is sure it was about the middle of said month of November. He marched immediately to Dorchester, near Boston, Mass. under Lieut Samuel Green of said Dorchester. On their arrival at Dorchester, Capt Pope (he thinks, William Pope of Lunenburg) took command of the company and said Green acted as Lieutenant. This [illegible] was called ""two months min"", but the term of service was but about almost six weeks. He remained in the service at said Dorchester until the 1st Jan 1776 or thereabouts and then discharged there. He had no written discharge, and he believes same of the company had. This declarant entered the union again on a call for men to go to New York in June 1776 (he thinks the 20th) and marched immediately to New York in the company commanded by Capt. Loring Lincoln of said Leicester [illegible] Green of Spencer was 1st Lieutenant and he thinks a Mr. [illegible] Holden 2 Lieutenant. He was attached to a regiment commanded by Col. Holman of Sutton.

His company was stationed a few weeks at New York - then at Harlem Heights a short time - [illegible] situated up the north river as far as the White Plains where this declarant was engaged in the battle with the British. The evening after the battle, they retreated up the river about a mile and half. Soon afterwards General Washington croped over the river into the Jerseys, and the declarant remained above the White Plains until about the first of December 1776 he thinks it was the 10the day of the month when he and the rest of his company were discharged and returne home to Leicester. This last term of service was five months and ten days. He had no written discharge. The only records which the declarant has his age, is contained into Family Bible, owned by his late father, in his hand writing the entry is made. He has no documentary evidence of service but annexed hereto as deposition of Peter Silvester, who was his fellow townsman found with him on both occasions above specified: He hereby relinquishes every claim whatever to a pension or annuity except the present, and declares that his name is not on the pension roll of the agency of any state.

One of the officers, with a provident foresight, had taken care to convert KELLY's capital into United States Bank notes and gold -- a sure passport through any part of Uncle Sam's domains, KELLY might be compared to a scathed oak in a forest of vigorous saplings; his trunk was left, but its branches were lopped off -- his offspring had pre- ceded him to the tomb, and he was left childless. With a comparatively light heart, KELLY started on his journey homeward, and being provided with a letter to Messrs STOCKTON & CO., the enterprising stage proprietors, of Baltimore, they generously franked the veteran in their line ""scot free"" to Wheeling; and we would that we could add the pleasing information that he reached his home in safety. But we have a far different story to relate -- that of his death by accident. A letter was received a few days since by a gentleman in this city, from W. FREY, Esq., the postmaster at Somerfield, Somerset County, Pa., giving the melancholy intelligence that the old soldier had been upset in the stage near that place, by which accident his collar bone was broken, and he was otherwise so seriously injured that no hopes of his recovery were entertained. Though languishing on the bed of pain, the veteran was not unmindful of those who had assisted him here in his distress; he dictated a letter expressing his grateful acknowledgements to the gentlemen in Washington who had aided him; and as he might not in all probability, have another opportunity to make his feelings known to them, he could not die in peace until he had eased his overcharged heart. Another letter from Mr. FREY, under date of the 26th March, announces that poor KELLY had breathed his last. Every attention that kindness could dictate was extended to him during the few days that he lingered on the bed of death, and his remains were followed to the grave by the clergy and many respectable citizens of Somerfield. --- In the North American Review for January, 1839, is a notice of ""STEPHEN'S Travels in the East,"" written, it is understood, by the late Secretary of War, Gov. CASS, who, it will be remembered, passed over subsequently a portion of the country described by Mr. STEPHENS, when he made a tour in the U.S. frigate Constitution, with Commodore ELLIOTT. On Mr. STEPHENS'S visit to Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt, the previous visit of Commodore PATTERSON in the U. S. ship Delaware was mentioned, and the Reviewer thus speaks of the 'incident.' ""We take pleasure in transcribing the following tribute of justice, and in adding our own feeble testimony to its truth. 'He,' the Pasha, 'knew America from a circumstance, which I afterwards found had done wonders in giving her a name and character in the East; the visit of Commodore PATTERSON, in the ship Delaware.' That gentleman has the present campaign will be brought down to a behind him an enviable reputation in the various [Right column:] countries of the Mediterranean, which he visited. We have followed him in his route, and have heard but one report of his hospitality, urbanity, and correct demeanor. His superb ship was a proud monument of the naval skill of his country, and the conduct of her officers and crew confirmed the favorable impression she was fitted to produce."" --- Maj. Gen. SCOTT arrived in Washington on Thursday, 4th instant, and left again last evening, for his head quarters at Elizabethtown, N. J. Maj Gen. JESUP will leave the city in a day or two for his residence in Kentucky. It is understood that he will return shortly with his family. The Board mentioned in our last number adjourned On Monday. The naval architects, we understand, are still in session, but it is probable will adjourn to meet again in Philadelphia some time next week. --- Correspondence of the Army and Navy Chronicle. FORT KING, FLA., [Florida] March 7, 1839. DEAR SIR: General TAYLOR arrived here yesterday, accompanied by his staff, and Col. T. CROSS, Assistant Quartermaster General. Capt. MACKAY and Lieut. BLAKE, Topographical Engineers, are ordered set about the survey of the country to be occupied with the ""system of squares."" This place proposed by General Taylor, and lately sanctioned by the War Department, and which has created no little discussion among the people of Florida and army officers in the country, is simply this: The peninsula between the Georgia line and a line parallel to it from a point on the Oklawaha, ten miles south of Fort King, is to be cut up into squares of twenty miles. In the middle of each, or as near the middle as health will permit, a small work will be built, garrisoned according to the nature of the country; generally, however, one company is deemed sufficient, one-third of them being mounted. If you take the map and divide the country in this manner, the results of the plan are obvious. Each officer in command of a district is held responsible that no Indians remain for a long time in it, or at least that they commit no murders or depredations with impunity. If the scouting party, daily sent out by the officer of each garrison, discovers a body of Indians too large for its immediate attack, how easily can a force sufficiently strong be raised from the contiguous post? The Indians will find it impossible to remain, or even to come within the districts. One reply can be brought against the objections to this plan. Every other heretofore tried has failed, and the only proof of the inefficacy of any plan is experience. The regiments will be more concentrated than they now are; the troops will be relieved of the toll and hardships they have so long undergone; the inhabitants of Florida, driven from their homes, can return; while ample protection is afforded to new comers. And, more than all, the expenditures of the public money (although greatly lessened during the present campaign) will be brought down to a mere trifle.

They were transported from the City in sloops to Albany, in April or May - thence to Fort Edward & Fort George, across Lake George, & to Lake Champlain-- thence to Crown Point, where they drew provision-- crossed Lake Champlain to St. John's fort, where they landed, & proceeded by land to Chamble?-- thence to the mouth of Lord? river, where they encamped. All the effective troops (amounting to about 1500.) excepting Winds Regiment, were detailed to go to the 3 rivers to meet the enemy, then in force there to the amount of about 7000. as was said Deponent believes that a Col. Thompson of Pennsylvania Regiment, commanded troops destined to the river. This was probably early in June. On the following day, a heavy firing was heard, & it was concluded that a battle had begun. Col. Wind's Regiment was soon got in readiness, & proceeded in battans down the Lord? to its junction with the St Lawrence, thence down to the Three Rivers where the battle was fought, & which was made on before Winds arrived.

He has long since been totally unable from bodily infirmities, to labor expended the whole of his little worldly estate, & is entirely dependent on his children for his bread & clothing.-- He now claims to be restored to his pension, or rather that his pension be restored to him, if consistent, under the the former law of 1818, if not under the act of June 7th 1832.- Beside the services already stated, he performed several tours of Militia duty in defence of his Country after his discharge in the winter of 1775.6. But the impressed state of his memory, & the entire want of evidence from the death of his associates, renders proof almost hopeless. He does not now know a single living witness on whom he can call. -- The winter of his return home, he was sick the whole time not recovering from the effects of Dysentery. In the summer preding Burgoynes capture, probably in 1777, he was drafted on a tour of militia duty of two months, under Captain Austin (or Augustin) Baily & Lieutenant George Bockover.

All applicants will appear before some Court of Record in the County in which they reside, and there subscribe and be sworn to, one of the declarations above provided, according to the nature of his case. The Court will propound the following (m) interrogatories to all applicants for a pension, on account of service in the Militia, State troops, or Volunteers, except the Militia of New Hampshire and the State troops of Virginia. 1. Where and in what year were you born? 2. Have you any record of your age, and if so, where is it? 3. Where were you living when called into service; where have you lived since the Revolutionary war, and where do you now live? 4. How were you called into service; were you drafted, did you volunteer, or were you a substitute? And if a substitute, for whom? 5.

To a Soldier. Did you ever receive a discharge from the service, and if so, by whom was it given and what has become of it? To an Officer. Did you ever receive a commission, and if so, by whom was it signed, and what has become of it? 7. State the names of persons to whom you are known in your present neighborhood, and who can testify as to your character for veracity, and their belief of your services as a soldier of the Revolution. The Court will see that the answers to these questions are embodied in the declaration, and they are requested to annex their opinions of the truth of the statement of the applicant. The applicant will further produce in Court, if the same can be done, in the opinion of the Court, without too much expense and inconvenience to him, two respectable persons--one of whom should be the nearest clergyman, if one lives in the immediate vicinity of such applicant, who can testify, from their acquaintance with him, that they believe he is of the age he represents, and that he is reputed and believed in the neighborhood to have been a Revolutionary soldier, and that they concur in that opinion. If one of these persons is a Clergyman, the Court will so certify, and they will also certify to the character and standing of other persons giving such certificates. The traditionary evidence of service is deemed very important, in the absence of any direct proof, except the declaration of the party. And the Courts are requested to be very particular in the enquiry whether the belief is general, and whether any doubts have ever existed upon the subject. Applicants unable to appear in Court, by reason of bodily infirmity, may make the declaration before required, and submit to the examination, before a Judge or Justice of a Court of Record of the proper county, and the Judge or Justice will execute the duties, which the Court is herein requested to perform, and will also certify that the applicant cannot, from bodily infirmity, attend the Court. Whenever any official act is required to be done by a Judge or Justice of a Court of Record, or by a Justice of the Peace, the certificate of the Secretary of State or Territory, or of the proper Clerk of the Court or County, under his seal of office, will be annexed, stating that such person is a Judge or Justice of a Court of Record, or a Justice of the Peace, and that the signature annexed is his genuine signature. No payments can be made on account of the services of any person, who may have died before the taking effect of the act of June 7, 1832; and in case of death subsequent thereto, and before the declaration herein required is made, the parties interested will transmit such evidence as they can procure, taken and authenticated before a Court of Record, showing the services of the deceased, the period of his death, the opinion of the neighborhood respecting such services, the title of the claimant, and the opinion of the Court upon the whole matter.

[c] The age of the claimant must invariably be mentioned. [d] The declarant must mention the person or persons of the war when he served. [e] Every continental officer or soldier must give the name of the Colonel under whom he served; otherwise a satisfactory examination of the claim cannot be had. Every claimant must state, with precision, the length of his service, and the different grades in which he served, in language definite as to enable the Department to determine to what amount of pension he is entitled. In a case where the applicant cannot, by reason of the loss of memory, state precisely how long he served, he should amend his declaration by making an affidavit in the following words ""Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, a Justice of the Peace, &c. A. B. who, being duly sworn, deposeth and saith, that, by reason of old age, and the consequent loss of memory, he cannot swear positively as to the precise length of his service; but, according to the best of his recollection, he served not less than the persons mentioned below, and in the following grades: --For----year---months, and ----days, I served as a ---For---months and ---days, I served as a ---; and for such service I claim a pension."" It is important, in all cases, to determine with precision the other for which each applicant served, and the particular rank he held, as the law directs the pension to be paid according to the grade of the pensioner and the length of his service. The use of the phrase about three or four months is too indefinite, and all such qualifying expressions are objectionable. Some persons who apply for pensions merely state that they served two years in the militia, &c, without specifying the tours, the names of the officers, and other particulars respecting their service. This form of a declaration is highly objectionable. It must, in every case, be clearly shown under what officers the applicant served; the duration of each term of engagement; the particular place or places where the service was performed, that the applicant served with an embodied corps called into service by competent authority; that he was either in the field or in garrison; and for the time during which the service was performed, he was not employed in any civil pursuit. [f] The law makes the relinquishment indispensable. [g] The opinion of the Court is always required. [h] The Clerk must give his certificate in every case. [i] The Clerk must affix his seal, and if it has no device or inscription by which it can be distinguished from any other seal, or if he has no public seal of office, the certificate of a Member of Congress, proving the official character and signature of the certifying officer, should accompany the papers.

Up to the battle of G. town which was in Oct 1777 at which time he was taken prisoner; which accounts for his name appearing on the pay roll, no longer than Oct. 1777. He was a prisoner 8 mo. And 12 days and no dout (sic) served out the bal. of his 3 years of the war enchanged (sic) – this may be inferred from his certificate of pay – It is also clearly in proof, by 3 respectable witnesses that claim he was in service after he was married – the witnesses differ it is true a little in regard to the time he Clarke (that is by month) went into the service, but agree exactly as to the month and year he came out. Which was the latter part of May 1781 – they all agree that he was in service after he was married and that it was winter when he left home. I think that the evidence is sufficient to entitle his widow to full pay as a corporal in the regular service. It was therefore only necessary to prove any of his services after marriage, in order to bring her under the law of 1836. Clarke was a deserving man, a good Christian, and a valiant soldier, and his widow is very needy. Do the best you can for him at any rate taking his regular, and militia services together, you can safely allow full pay as corporal.

A. Muhlenberg some few days ago and felt deeply wounded and disappointed by the contents. It may however not be simple to say in reply that in the spring of 1774 I took an oath of allegiance, and in 1775 I continued to learn military exercise under the instruction of a Mr. Whitterson. I know not what was his rank in the Army but he was sent out in our neighborhood to instruct us in military tactics. I am now an old man of 84 years and of course forgetful, and I do solemnly protest before God & my Country that in the sending of discharge which now you hold, I had not even remotely an intention to deceive. The Wars being over and peace restored, many of the soldiers of those times received donation lands, some of which I purchased from them, they left me these Deeds and papers, and doubtless the discharge alluded to must be one of theirs. I beg therefore with deep humility to apologize and fervently declare to the Judge of all hearts that I took it to be my own through error or neglect, and that I did not obliterate or otherwise decipher a word of the same. The stupidity of such conduct wd be too prominent, and the discrepancy too glaring for ever an Idiot not to notice.

This was I think in the month of September; we ran out of ammunition & were therefore obliged to give way; The British crossed the Schuylkill & we came up on the other side; Having marched faster than they did. They crossed over again behind us & proceeded to Germantown where we over took them and had another battle with them. At Brandywine I was wounded in the breast by a musket ball; When the two months were up - the term of our service - I was discharged - but whether by a written or a paid discharge I don't remember. After my discharge I returned to Linton Township, Northampton County.

I yesterday offered a resolution in ^the^ House, instructing (word crossed out) the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions to enquire into the expediency of restoring the names of John Fox, Jacob Fleisher, Michael Spatz and Adam Gramling to the pension roll. I take the liberty of handing you some papers relating to the three first mentioned cases and of submitting a few remarks. The petitions handed me from Fox & Fleisher only, but by referring to them and the annexed depositions, it will immediately be perceived that the cases stand on the same footing & are exactly similar. Spatz was on the Pension List of 1818 as well as Fox & Fleisher. I have known these three men personally about 25 years. They are admitted by all who know them, to be honest & worthy men, of the strictest veracity, whose assertion would be admitted without an oath. It is a matter of notoriety among the old people of the place where they reside that their statements as to services & sufferings are correct. Fox and Fleisher are in very reduced circumstances, poverty stricken, as well as aged & infirm. The latter particularly has been contracted in his limbs by rheumatism & confined to his bed & room for many years, in consequence, it is supposed, of the hardships he induced on the Jersey Prison ship. He is maintained by poor relatives. Spatz has a house and lot which may be worth about $500 in which he resides.
