// frequency
// got all rows with transcriptionText
// got frequency count for everything
// discarded any words with fewer than 100

// animals - farm animals (horse was the most commonly occuring animal in general, but also used in other cirucmstances)
// religion - religion was the second most commonly occuring category, but also used in other cirucmstances
// hopelessness - hopelessness originally included all words like "death", "died", "killed" etc. but I filtered the list down to words that most describes the feeling of despair

// filtering the df for samples to display on the frontend:
// prioritized files that contained multiple themes and/or multiple key words (to reduce necessary rows and also capture rich stories (for example, a list of animals rather than a single mention of a cow))
// have at least 100 instances of each word
// prioritized NAIDs (applications) that contained multiple files with themes/ words
