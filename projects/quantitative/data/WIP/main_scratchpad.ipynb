And,\\\\nif not, which of them is not so answered?\\\\n1881,\\\\n1\\\\n3\\\\nH IV\\\\nEXPLANATORY NOTES.\\\\nQUERE V. In a case where the applicant cannot, by reason of the loss of memory, state precisely how\\\\nlong he served, he should amend his declaration by making an affidavit in the following words:\\\\nin Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, a Justice of the Peace, &c. A. B. who, being\\\\nduly sworn, deposeth and saith, that, by reason of old age, and the consequent loss of memory, he\\\\ncannot swear positively as to the precise length of his service, but according to the best of his recolthan\\\\nthe periods mentioned below, and in the following grades; Fortion\\\\nhe served months and days, I served as a For months\\\\nanddays\\\\n, I served as aand\\\\nfor such service I claim a pension.\", \"It is important in all cases to determine with precision the period for which each applicant served,\\\\nand the particular rank he held, as the law directs the pension to be paid according to the grade of the\\\\npensioner and the length of his service. The use of the phrase about three or four months is too indefinite\\\\n, and all such qualifying expressions are objectionable. Some persons who apply for pensions\\\\nmerely state they served two years in the militia, &c. without specifying the tours; the names of the\\\\nofficers, and other particulars respecting their service. This form of a declaration is highly objection\\\\nable. It must in every case be clearly shewn under what officers the applicant served; the duration\\\\nof each term of engagement; the particular place or places where the service was performed; that the\\\\napplicant served with an embodied corps called into service by competent authority; that he was either\\\\nin the field or in garrison; and for the time during which the service was performed, he was not employed\\\\nin any civil pursuit.\\\\nQUERE XIV. Proof of Service.\\\\nIn a case where the name of the applicant is not found on the records of the Department, he must\\\\nprove his service by two credible witnesses, who are required to set forth in their affidavits the time of\\\\nthe claimants entering the service, and the time and manner of his leaving the same, as well as the\\\\nregiment, company, and line to which he belonged. The magistrate who may administer the oaths\\\\nmust certify to the credibility of the witnesses, and the official character and signature of the magistrate\\\\nmust be certified by the proper officer, under his seal of office.\\\\nQUERE XVI. Mode of authenticating papers.\\\\nIn every instance where the certificate of the certifying officer who authenticates the papers is not\\\\nwritten on the same sheet of paper which contains the affidavit, or other paper authenticated, the certificate\\\\nmust be attached thereto by a piece of tape or narrow ribbon, the ends of which must pass\\\\nunder the seal of office of the certifying officer, so as to prevent any paper from being improperly\\\\nattached to the certificate.\\\\nIn every case where the clerk of the court, or other certifying officer, has no public seal of\\\\noffice, the certificate of a member of congress, proving the official character and signature of the\\\\ncertifying officer, should accompany the papers.\\\\n-\", \"M\\\\nat\\\\nCaint for\\\\ners in the \\\\u2503\\\\nby the Pres of U.S. Bank\\\\nAgency of Kentucky\\\\nPage\\\\nRecorded in the Pension Office\\\\n, in Book E Vol.\\\\nJames\\\\nPayments to be made\\\\nLexington\\\\nby\\\\nBand\\\\nClerk.\", \"WAR DEPARTMENT.\\\\nRevolutionary Claim.\\\\nI certify that in conformity with the law of the United States\\\\nof the 7th June, 1832,\\\\nAbraham\\\\nAland\\\\nof the State of\\\\n\\\\nKentuckywho\\\\nwas a private in the army of the Revolution\\\\nis entitled to receive Forty\\\\ndollars and\\\\n---\\\\ncents per annum, during his natural life,\\\\non the 4th of March, 1831, and payable semi-annually on the\\\\nMarch, and 4th of September, in every year\\\\ncommencing\\\\n.\\\\nCoun\\\\nGiven at the War Office of the United States\\\\n, this\\\\nSwelth\\\\nday of\\\\nApril\\\\none thousand\\\\neight hundred and thirty -three\\\\nLew Cap\\\\nJ L Edwards\\\\nCommissioner of Pensions.\\\\nSecretary of War.\", \"WITH SAdle\\\\n\\\\n7434\\\\nhim but\", \"1835\\\\nColumbia. 11th\\\\nDear Sir\\\\nMay\\\\nI was from home when yours of the\\\\n18th\\\\ntime come to this place immed\\\\niately upon my arrival I procured the\\\\n\\\\u25cf\\\\nPension Certificate of Abraham Aarons\\\\nwhich I enclose you agreeable to\\\\nyour request\\\\nI am dear Sir\\\\nRespectfully your\\\\nmost obt svt\\\\n.\\\\nWm\\\\nOwens\"]'"
