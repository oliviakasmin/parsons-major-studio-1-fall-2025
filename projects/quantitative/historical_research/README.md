## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology Note for JSON

The JSON timeline was created directly from the **M804 pamphlet**, with **exact quoted text and page references** included for each entry. Only minor refinements were added from the **NPS article** to clarify scope (militia eligibility under 1832; widow definition under 1836). No other sources were used, and no information was inferred beyond these documents.
