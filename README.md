### Bureaucracy in the Revolutionary War Era - The Very Human Burden of Applying for a Pension

https://okasmin-parsons-major-studio-1.netlify.app/

This project explores pension data from the American Revolutionary War Pension Files collection. Users are introduced to the progression of congressional acts regarding veteran pensions and the distribution of pension applications attributed to each category (including survivors, widows, rejected, and bounty land warrants). Data has been extracted from the text using a lightweight LLM model to collect the dollar amount awarded to the recipient as well as other related fields, such as where the pension was issued and which congressional act it corresponds to. Furthermore, the text has been analyzed for commonly occurring words and themes to unearth the human stories buried within bureaucratic paperwork. The analysis is presented through interactive interfaces that allows users to discover this rich collection and provide an opportunity to have an individual dialogue with Americans from hundreds of years ago.
