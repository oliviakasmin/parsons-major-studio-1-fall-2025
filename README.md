Title: Bureaucracy in the Revolutionary War Era; The Very Human Burden of Applying for a Pension

Description: This project explores pension amount data from the Revolution Crossroads â€“ NARA Revolutionary War Pension Files collection. It first examines the distribution of records in the collection attributed to survivors (soldiers), widows, and those whose applications were rejected, as well as the average number of pages for each category. I also extracted data from the text using a lightweight LLM model to collect the dollar amounts awarded to recipients and other related fields, such as where the pension was issued and which congressional act it corresponds to. This analysis is presented through an interface that allows users to select a year, applicant type (widow or soldier), and location; a matching record is fetched and then the scan is displayed for users to see a real example of this case.
