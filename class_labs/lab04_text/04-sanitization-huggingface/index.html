    <title>String Sanitization with SymSpell</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <div>
      This lab's <code>main.js</code> file is a reference for potentially useful <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=string+sanitization">string sanitization</a> on text you will query from
      <a href="https://huggingface.co">Huggingface</a>.
      <br><br>
      The cleanUpText() function in main.js contains some common text cleanup operations, specifically geared toward text that was parced by OCR.
      <br><br>
      Play around with it, modify it, make it fit your needs.

      <i>
        The main upside to using some simple javascript like this instead of calling a library or LLM to fix your text, is that it is fast and free.
      </i>

      <br><br>
      The main downside is that it might not as powerful and precise at correcting as an LLM.

    If you want to experiment with LLMs I suggest reading <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries">this guide</a> by OpenAI on:
      <ol>
        <li>
          how to make an api key
        </li>
        <li>how to add it to an environment variable</li>
        <li>how to call the api</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div>
      As you'll notice in the guide, this will require you to have a more complete web application set up, with npm (node package manager) so you can install the OpenAI library.
      <br><br>
      If people like we could do a dedicated project setup workshop sometime during lab to help with getting started here.
